  abstract: "Cells must adapt to environmental changes to maintain homeostasis. One\
    \ of the most striking environmental adaptations is entry into hibernation during\
    \ which core body temperature can decrease from 37\xB0C to as low at 4\xB0C. How\
    \ mammalian cells, which evolved to optimally function within a narrow range of\
    \ temperatures, adapt to this profound decrease in temperature remains poorly\
    \ understood. In this study, we conducted the first genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen\
    \ in cells derived from Syrian hamster, a facultative hibernator, as well as human\
    \ cells to investigate the genetic basis of cold tolerance in a hibernator and\
    \ a non-hibernator in an unbiased manner. Both screens independently revealed\
    \ glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenium-containing enzyme, and associated\
    \ proteins as critical for cold tolerance. We utilized genetic and pharmacological\
    \ approaches to demonstrate that GPX4 is active in the cold and its catalytic\
    \ activity is required for cold tolerance. Furthermore, we show that the role\
    \ of GPX4 as a suppressor of cold-induced cell death extends across hibernating\
    \ species, including 13-lined ground squirrels and greater horseshoe bats, highlighting\
    \ the evolutionary conservation of this mechanism of cold tolerance. This study\
    \ identifies GPX4 as a central modulator of mammalian cold tolerance and advances\
    \ our understanding of the evolved mechanisms by which cells mitigate cold-associated\
    \ damage-one of the most common challenges faced by cells and organisms in nature."

  abstract: Single cell CRISPR screens such as Perturb-seq enable transcriptomic profiling
    of genetic perturbations at scale. However, the data produced by these screens
    are often noisy due to cost and technical constraints, limiting power to detect
    true effects with conventional differential expression analyses. Here, we introduce
    TRanscriptome-wide Analysis of Differential Expression (TRADE), a statistical
    framework which estimates the transcriptome-wide distribution of true differential
    expression effects from noisy gene-level measurements. Within TRADE, we derive
    multiple novel, interpretable statistical metrics, including the "transcriptome-wide
    impact", an estimator of the overall transcriptional effect of a perturbation
    which is stable across sampling depths. We analyze new and published large-scale
    Perturb-seq datasets to show that many true transcriptional effects are not statistically
    significant, but detectable in aggregate with TRADE. In a genome-scale Perturb-seq
    screen, we find that a typical gene perturbation affects an estimated 45 genes,
    whereas a typical essential gene perturbation affects over 500 genes. An advantage
    of our approach is its ability to compare the transcriptomic effects of genetic
    perturbations across contexts and dosages despite differences in power. We use
    this ability to identify perturbations with cell-type dependent effects and to
    find examples of perturbations where transcriptional responses are not only larger
    in magnitude, but also qualitatively different, as a function of dosage. Lastly,
    we expand our analysis to case/control comparison of gene expression for neuropsychiatric
    conditions, finding that transcriptomic effect correlations are greater than genetic
    correlations for these diagnoses. TRADE lays an analytic foundation for the systematic
    comparison of genetic perturbation atlases, as well as differential expression
    experiments more broadly.

  abstract: Control of cellular identity requires coordination of developmental programs
    with environmental factors such as nutrient availability, suggesting that perturbing
    metabolism can alter cell state. Here, we find that nucleotide depletion and DNA
    replication stress drive differentiation in human and murine normal and transformed
    hematopoietic systems, including patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
    xenografts. These cell state transitions begin during S phase and are independent
    of ATR/ATM checkpoint signaling, double-stranded DNA break formation, and changes
    in cell cycle length. In systems where differentiation is blocked by oncogenic
    transcription factor expression, replication stress activates primed regulatory
    loci and induces lineage-appropriate maturation genes despite the persistence
    of progenitor programs. Altering the baseline cell state by manipulating transcription
    factor expression causes replication stress to induce genes specific for alternative
    lineages. The ability of replication stress to selectively activate primed maturation
    programs across different contexts suggests a general mechanism by which changes
    in metabolism can promote lineage-appropriate cell state transitions.

  abstract: Learning and memory require activity-induced changes in dendritic translation,
    but which mRNAs are involved and how they are regulated are unclear. In this study,
    to monitor how depolarization impacts local dendritic biology, we employed a dendritically
    targeted proximity labeling approach followed by crosslinking immunoprecipitation,
    ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry. Depolarization of primary cortical neurons
    with KCl or the glutamate agonist DHPG caused rapid reprogramming of dendritic
    protein expression, where changes in dendritic mRNAs and proteins are weakly correlated.
    For a subset of pre-localized messages, depolarization increased the translation
    of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and their downstream coding sequences,
    enabling localized production of proteins involved in long-term potentiation,
    cell signaling and energy metabolism. This activity-dependent translation was
    accompanied by the phosphorylation and recruitment of the non-canonical translation
    initiation factor eIF4G2, and the translated uORFs were sufficient to confer depolarization-induced,
    eIF4G2-dependent translational control. These studies uncovered an unanticipated
    mechanism by which activity-dependent uORF translational control by eIF4G2 couples
    activity to local dendritic remodeling.

  abstract: Our ability to edit genomes lags behind our capacity to sequence them,
    but the growing understanding of CRISPR biology and its application to genome,
    epigenome and transcriptome engineering is narrowing this gap. In this Review,
    we discuss recent developments of various CRISPR-based systems that can transiently
    or permanently modify the genome and the transcriptome. The discovery of further
    CRISPR enzymes and systems through functional metagenomics has meaningfully broadened
    the applicability of CRISPR-based editing. Engineered Cas variants offer diverse
    capabilities such as base editing, prime editing, gene insertion and gene regulation,
    thereby providing a panoply of tools for the scientific community. We highlight
    the strengths and weaknesses of current CRISPR tools, considering their efficiency,
    precision, specificity, reliance on cellular DNA repair mechanisms and their applications
    in both fundamental biology and therapeutics. Finally, we discuss ongoing clinical
    trials that illustrate the potential impact of CRISPR systems on human health.

  abstract: The genetic principle of synthetic lethality is clinically validated in
    cancers with loss of specific DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genes (i.e. BRCA1/2
    tumor suppressor mutations). The broader question of whether and how oncogenes
    create tumor-specific vulnerabilities within DDR networks remains unanswered.
    Native FET protein family members are among the earliest proteins recruited to
    DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during the DDR, though the function of both native
    FET proteins and FET fusion oncoproteins in DSB repair remains poorly defined.
    Here we focus on Ewing sarcoma (ES), an EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein-driven pediatric
    bone tumor, as a model for FET rearranged cancers. We discover that the EWS-FLI1
    fusion oncoprotein is recruited to DNA DSBs and interferes with native EWS function
    in activating the DNA damage sensor ATM. Using preclinical mechanistic approaches
    and clinical datasets, we establish functional ATM deficiency as a principal DNA
    repair defect in ES and the compensatory ATR signaling axis as a collateral dependency
    and therapeutic target in FET rearranged cancers. Thus, aberrant recruitment of
    a fusion oncoprotein to sites of DNA damage can disrupt normal DSB repair, revealing
    a mechanism for how oncogenes can create cancer-specific synthetic lethality within
    DDR networks.

  abstract: Comparative studies of great apes provide a window into our evolutionary
    past, but the extent and identity of cellular differences that emerged during
    hominin evolution remain largely unexplored. We established a comparative loss-of-function
    approach to evaluate whether human cells exhibit distinct genetic dependencies.
    By performing genome-wide CRISPR interference screens in human and chimpanzee
    pluripotent stem cells, we identified 75 genes with species-specific effects on
    cellular proliferation. These genes comprised coherent processes, including cell-cycle
    progression and lysosomal signaling, which we determined to be human-derived by
    comparison with orangutan cells. Human-specific robustness to CDK2 and CCNE1 depletion
    persisted in neural progenitor cells and cerebral organoids, supporting the G1-phase
    length hypothesis as a potential evolutionary mechanism in human brain expansion.
    Our findings demonstrate that evolutionary changes in human cells reshaped the
    landscape of essential genes and establish a platform for systematically uncovering
    latent cellular and molecular differences between species.

  abstract: Translation of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) results
    in truncated protein products with deleterious effects. Nonsense-mediated decay
    (NMD) is a surveillance pathway responsible for detecting PTC containing transcripts.
    Although the molecular mechanisms governing mRNA degradation have been extensively
    studied, the fate of the nascent protein product remains largely uncharacterized.
    Here, we use a fluorescent reporter system in mammalian cells to reveal a selective
    degradation pathway specifically targeting the protein product of an NMD mRNA.
    We show that this process is post-translational and dependent on the ubiquitin
    proteasome system. To systematically uncover factors involved in NMD-linked protein
    quality control, we conducted genome-wide flow cytometry-based screens. Our screens
    recovered known NMD factors but suggested that protein degradation did not depend
    on the canonical ribosome-quality control (RQC) pathway. A subsequent arrayed
    screen demonstrated that protein and mRNA branches of NMD rely on a shared recognition
    event. Our results establish the existence of a targeted pathway for nascent protein
    degradation from PTC containing mRNAs, and provide a reference for the field to
    identify and characterize required factors.

  abstract: While oncogenes promote cancer cell growth, unrestrained proliferation
    represents a significant stressor to cellular homeostasis networks such as the
    DNA damage response (DDR). To enable oncogene tolerance, many cancers disable
    tumor suppressive DDR signaling through genetic loss of DDR pathways and downstream
    effectors (e.g., ATM or p53 tumor suppressor mutations). Whether and how oncogenes
    can help "self-tolerize" by creating analogous functional deficiencies in physiologic
    DDR networks is not known. Here we focus on Ewing sarcoma, a FET fusion oncoprotein
    (EWS-FLI1) driven pediatric bone tumor, as a model for the class of FET rearranged
    cancers. Native FET protein family members are among the earliest factors recruited
    to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during the DDR, though the function of both
    native FET proteins and FET fusion oncoproteins in DNA repair remains to be defined.
    Using preclinical mechanistic studies of the DDR and clinical genomic datasets
    from patient tumors, we discover that the EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein is recruited
    to DNA DSBs and interferes with native FET (EWS) protein function in activating
    the DNA damage sensor ATM. As a consequence of FET fusion-mediated interference
    with the DDR, we establish functional ATM deficiency as the principal DNA repair
    defect in Ewing sarcoma and the compensatory ATR signaling axis as a collateral
    dependency and therapeutic target in multiple FET rearranged cancers. More generally,
    we find that aberrant recruitment of a fusion oncoprotein to sites of DNA damage
    can disrupt physiologic DSB repair, revealing a mechanism for how growth-promoting
    oncogenes can also create a functional deficiency within tumor suppressive DDR
    networks.

  abstract: "The translation initiation machinery and the ribosome orchestrate a highly\
    \ dynamic scanning process to distinguish proper start codons from surrounding\
    \ nucleotide sequences. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi screens in human\
    \ K562 cells to systematically identify modulators of the frequency of translation\
    \ initiation at near-cognate start codons. We observed that depletion of any eIF3\
    \ core subunit promoted near-cognate start codon usage, though sensitivity thresholds\
    \ of each subunit to sgRNA-mediated depletion varied considerably. Double sgRNA\
    \ depletion experiments suggested that enhanced near-cognate usage in eIF3D depleted\
    \ cells required canonical eIF4E cap-binding and was not driven by eIF2A or eIF2D-dependent\
    \ leucine tRNA initiation. We further characterized the effects of eIF3D depletion\
    \ and found that the N-terminus of eIF3D was strictly required for accurate start\
    \ codon selection, whereas disruption of the cap-binding properties of eIF3D had\
    \ no effect. Lastly, depletion of eIF3D activated TNF\u03B1 signaling via NF-\u03BA\
    B and the interferon gamma response. Similar transcriptional profiles were observed\
    \ upon knockdown of eIF1A and eIF4G2, which also promoted near-cognate start codon\
    \ usage, suggesting that enhanced near-cognate usage could potentially contribute\
    \ to NF-\u03BAB activation. Our study thus provides new avenues to study the mechanisms\
    \ and consequences of alternative start codon usage."

  abstract: Current single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches have limitations that stem
    from the microfluidic devices or fluid handling steps required for sample processing.
    We develop a method that does not require specialized microfluidic devices, expertise
    or hardware. Our approach is based on particle-templated emulsification, which
    allows single-cell encapsulation and barcoding of cDNA in uniform droplet emulsions
    with only a vortexer. Particle-templated instant partition sequencing (PIP-seq)
    accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates
    and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells
    to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes
    in mouse-human mixing studies, is compatible with multiomics measurements and
    can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue compared to a commercial
    microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype
    acute leukemia using PIP-seq reveals the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy-resistant
    cell subsets that were hidden by standard immunophenotyping. PIP-seq is a simple,
    flexible and scalable next-generation workflow that extends single-cell sequencing
    to new applications.

  abstract: The ability to map genetic interactions has been essential for determining
    gene function and defining biological pathways. Therefore, a system to readily
    perform genome-wide genetic modifier screens in human cells is a powerful platform
    for dissecting complex processes in mammalian cells, where redundancy and adaptation
    commonly mask the phenotype of a single genetic perturbation. Here, we report
    a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) based platform, compatible with Fluorescence Activated
    Cell Sorting (FACS)-based reporter screens, that can be used to query epistatic
    relationships at scale. This is enabled by a flexible dual-sgRNA library design
    that allows for the simultaneous delivery and selection of a fixed sgRNA and a
    second randomized guide, comprised of a genome-wide library, with a single transduction.
    As a proof of principle, we apply our approach to study the pathways that mediate
    tail-anchored (TA) protein insertion at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We show
    that this dual-guide library approach can be successfully coupled with FACS-based
    reporter screening, to identify genetic epistasis and thereby place TA biogenesis
    factors in their respective parallel pathways. We demonstrate that this dual-guide
    approach is both more sensitive and specific than traditional growth screening
    approaches, and is ideally suited for dissecting the complex interplay between
    factors in human cells.

  abstract: CRISPR screens are a powerful source of biological discovery, enabling
    the unbiased interrogation of gene function in a wide range of applications and
    species. In pooled CRISPR screens, various genetically encoded perturbations are
    introduced into pools of cells. The targeted cells proliferate under a biological
    challenge such as cell competition, drug treatment or viral infection. Subsequently,
    the perturbation-induced effects are evaluated by sequencing-based counting of
    the guide RNAs that specify each perturbation. The typical results of such screens
    are ranked lists of genes that confer sensitivity or resistance to the biological
    challenge of interest. Contributing to the broad utility of CRISPR screens, adaptations
    of the core CRISPR technology make it possible to activate, silence or otherwise
    manipulate the target genes. Moreover, high-content read-outs such as single-cell
    RNA sequencing and spatial imaging help characterize screened cells with unprecedented
    detail. Dedicated software tools facilitate bioinformatic analysis and enhance
    reproducibility. CRISPR screening has unravelled various molecular mechanisms
    in basic biology, medical genetics, cancer research, immunology, infectious diseases,
    microbiology and other fields. This Primer describes the basic and advanced concepts
    of CRISPR screening and its application as a flexible and reliable method for
    biological discovery, biomedical research and drug development - with a special
    emphasis on high-content methods that make it possible to obtain detailed biological
    insights directly as part of the screen.

  abstract: CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) enables programmable, reversible, and titratable
    repression of gene expression (knockdown) in mammalian cells. Initial CRISPRi-mediated
    genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic questions in cell
    biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of CRISPRi screening
    has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and
    challenges in generating cell models with consistent CRISPRi-mediated knockdown.
    Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA libraries and effector expression
    constructs that enable strong and consistent knockdown across mammalian cell models.
    First, we combine empirical sgRNA selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to
    generate an ultra-compact (1-3 elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA
    library. Next, we compare CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published
    Zim3-dCas9 provides an excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and
    minimal non-specific effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we
    engineer a suite of cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust
    on-target knockdown. Our results and publicly available reagents establish best
    practices for CRISPRi genetic screening.

  abstract: Human chromosomes are pervasively transcribed, but systematic understanding
    of coding and lncRNA genome function in cell differentiation is lacking. Using
    CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in human induced pluripotent stem cells, we performed
    dual genome-wide screens - assessing 18,905 protein-coding and 10,678 lncRNA loci
    - and identified 419 coding and 201 lncRNA genes that regulate neural induction.
    Integrative analyses revealed distinct properties of coding and lncRNA genome
    function, including a 10-fold enrichment of lncRNA genes for roles in differentiation
    compared to proliferation. Further, we applied Perturb-seq to obtain granular
    insights into neural induction phenotypes. While most coding hits stalled or aborted
    differentiation, lncRNA hits were enriched for the genesis of diverse cellular
    states, including those outside the neural lineage. In addition to providing a
    rich resource (danlimlab.shinyapps.io/dualgenomewide) for understanding coding
    and lncRNA gene function in development, these results indicate that the lncRNA
    genome regulates lineage commitment in a manner fundamentally distinct from coding
    genes.

  abstract: Oncogenic FOXO1 gene fusions drive a subset of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
    with poor survival and to date these cancer drivers are therapeutically intractable.
    To identify new therapies for this disease, we undertook an isogenic CRISPR-interference
    screen to define PAX3-FOXO1 specific genetic dependencies and identified genes
    in the GATOR2 complex. GATOR2 loss in RMS abrogated amino acid-induced lysosomal
    localization of mTORC1 and consequent downstream signaling, slowing G1-S cell
    cycle transition. In vivo suppression of GATOR2 impaired the growth of tumor xenografts
    and favored the outgrowth of cells lacking PAX3-FOXO1. Loss of a subset of GATOR2
    members can be compensated by direct genetic activation of mTORC1. RAS mutations
    are also sufficient to decouple mTORC1 activation from GATOR2, and indeed fusion
    negative RMS harboring such mutations exhibit amino acid-independent mTORC1 activity.
    A bi-steric, mTORC1-selective small molecule induced tumor regressions in fusion
    positive patient-derived tumor xenografts. These findings highlight a vulnerability
    in FOXO1 fusion positive RMS and provide rationale for the clinical evaluation
    of bi-steric mTORC1 inhibitors, currently in phase 1 testing, to treat this disease.
    Isogenic genetic screens can thus identify potentially exploitable vulnerabilities
    in fusion driven pediatric cancers which otherwise remain mostly undruggable.

  abstract: Cellular barcodes are distinct DNA sequences that enable one to track
    specific cells across time or space. Recent advances in our ability to detect
    natural or synthetic cellular barcodes, paired with single-cell readouts of cell
    state, have markedly increased our knowledge of clonal dynamics and genealogies
    of the cells that compose a variety of tissues and organs. These advances hold
    promise to redefine our view of human disease. Here, we provide an overview of
    cellular barcoding approaches, discuss applications to gain new insights into
    disease mechanisms, and provide an outlook on future applications. We discuss
    unanticipated insights gained through barcoding in studies of cancer and blood
    cell production and describe how barcoding can be applied to a growing array of
    medical fields, particularly with the increasing recognition of clonal contributions
    in human diseases.

  abstract: Mutations in Ras family proteins are implicated in 33% of human cancers,
    but direct pharmacological inhibition of Ras mutants remains challenging. As an
    alternative to direct inhibition, we screened for sensitivities in Ras-mutant
    cells and discovered 249C as a Ras-mutant selective cytotoxic agent with nanomolar
    potency against a spectrum of Ras-mutant cancers. 249C binds to vacuolar (V)-ATPase
    with nanomolar affinity and inhibits its activity, preventing lysosomal acidification
    and inhibiting autophagy and macropinocytosis pathways that several Ras-driven
    cancers rely on for survival. Unexpectedly, potency of 249C varies with the identity
    of the Ras driver mutation, with the highest potency for KRASG13D and G12V both
    in vitro and in vivo, highlighting a mutant-specific dependence on macropinocytosis
    and lysosomal pH. Indeed, 249C potently inhibits tumor growth without adverse
    side effects in mouse xenografts of KRAS-driven lung and colon cancers. A comparison
    of isogenic SW48 xenografts with different KRAS mutations confirmed that KRASG13D/+
    (followed by G12V/+) mutations are especially sensitive to 249C treatment. These
    data establish proof-of-concept for targeting V-ATPase in cancers driven by specific
    KRAS mutations such as KRASG13D and G12V.

  abstract: The potential of small molecules to localize within subcellular compartments
    is rarely explored. To probe this question, we measured the localization of Hsp70
    inhibitors using fluorescence microscopy. We found that even closely related analogs
    had dramatically different distributions, with some residing predominantly in
    the mitochondria and others in the ER. CRISPRi screens supported this idea, showing
    that different compounds had distinct chemogenetic interactions with Hsp70s of
    the ER (HSPA5/BiP) and mitochondria (HSPA9/mortalin) and their co-chaperones.
    Moreover, localization seemed to determine function, even for molecules with conserved
    binding sites. Compounds with distinct partitioning have distinct anti-proliferative
    activity in breast cancer cells compared with anti-viral activity in cellular
    models of Dengue virus replication, likely because different sets of Hsp70s are
    required in these processes. These findings highlight the contributions of subcellular
    partitioning and chemogenetic interactions to small molecule activity, features
    that are rarely explored during medicinal chemistry campaigns.

  abstract: A central goal of genetics is to define the relationships between genotypes
    and phenotypes. High-content phenotypic screens such as Perturb-seq (CRISPR-based
    screens with single-cell RNA-sequencing readouts) enable massively parallel functional
    genomic mapping but, to date, have been used at limited scales. Here, we perform
    genome-scale Perturb-seq targeting all expressed genes with CRISPR interference
    (CRISPRi) across >2.5 million human cells. We use transcriptional phenotypes to
    predict the function of poorly characterized genes, uncovering new regulators
    of ribosome biogenesis (including CCDC86, ZNF236, and SPATA5L1), transcription
    (C7orf26), and mitochondrial respiration (TMEM242). In addition to assigning gene
    function, single-cell transcriptional phenotypes allow for in-depth dissection
    of complex cellular phenomena-from RNA processing to differentiation. We leverage
    this ability to systematically identify genetic drivers and consequences of aneuploidy
    and to discover an unanticipated layer of stress-specific regulation of the mitochondrial
    genome. Our information-rich genotype-phenotype map reveals a multidimensional
    portrait of gene and cellular function.

  abstract: Genome-wide association studies in combination with single-cell genomic
    atlases can provide insights into the mechanisms of disease-causal genetic variation.
    However, identification of disease-relevant or trait-relevant cell types, states
    and trajectories is often hampered by sparsity and noise, particularly in the
    analysis of single-cell epigenomic data. To overcome these challenges, we present
    SCAVENGE, a computational algorithm that uses network propagation to map causal
    variants to their relevant cellular context at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate
    how SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic
    variation, applying the method to blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis,
    to monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019
    (COVID-19) and to intermediate lymphocyte developmental states that predispose
    to acute leukemia. Our approach not only provides a framework for enabling variant-to-function
    insights at single-cell resolution but also suggests a more general strategy for
    maximizing the inferences that can be made using single-cell genomic data.

  abstract: Tumor evolution is driven by the progressive acquisition of genetic and
    epigenetic alterations that enable uncontrolled growth and expansion to neighboring
    and distal tissues. The study of phylogenetic relationships between cancer cells
    provides key insights into these processes. Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing
    system with a single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven
    lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor evolution from single-transformed cells
    to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the
    initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a transient increase
    in plasticity. This was followed by the adoption of distinct transcriptional programs
    that enable rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable subclones
    capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary
    trajectories, and perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates progression
    by creating novel trajectories. Our study elucidates the hierarchical nature of
    tumor evolution and, more broadly, enables in-depth studies of tumor progression.

  abstract: Elucidating the wiring diagram of the human cell is a central goal of
    the postgenomic era. We combined genome engineering, confocal live-cell imaging,
    mass spectrometry, and data science to systematically map the localization and
    interactions of human proteins. Our approach provides a data-driven description
    of the molecular and spatial networks that organize the proteome. Unsupervised
    clustering of these networks delineates functional communities that facilitate
    biological discovery. We found that remarkably precise functional information
    can be derived from protein localization patterns, which often contain enough
    information to identify molecular interactions, and that RNA binding proteins
    form a specific subgroup defined by unique interaction and localization properties.
    Paired with a fully interactive website (opencell.czbiohub.org), our work constitutes
    a resource for the quantitative cartography of human cellular organization.

  abstract: With burgeoning human disease genetic associations and single-cell genomic
    atlases covering a range of tissues, there are unprecedented opportunities to
    systematically gain insights into the mechanisms of disease-causal variation.
    However, sparsity and noise, particularly in the context of single-cell epigenomic
    data, hamper the identification of disease- or trait-relevant cell types, states,
    and trajectories. To overcome these challenges, we have developed the SCAVENGE
    method, which maps causal variants to their relevant cellular context at single-cell
    resolution by employing the strategy of network propagation. We demonstrate how
    SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic
    variation including enrichment of blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis,
    defining monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe coronavirus disease
    2019 (COVID-19), and identifying intermediate lymphocyte developmental states
    that are critical for predisposition to acute leukemia. Our approach not only
    provides a framework for enabling variant-to-function insights at single-cell
    resolution, but also suggests a more general strategy for maximizing the inferences
    that can be made using single-cell genomic data.

  abstract: Single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, together with RNA velocity and metabolic labeling,
    reveals cellular states and transitions at unprecedented resolution. Fully exploiting
    these data, however, requires kinetic models capable of unveiling governing regulatory
    functions. Here, we introduce an analytical framework dynamo (https://github.com/aristoteleo/dynamo-release),
    which infers absolute RNA velocity, reconstructs continuous vector fields that
    predict cell fates, employs differential geometry to extract underlying regulations,
    and ultimately predicts optimal reprogramming paths and perturbation outcomes.
    We highlight dynamo's power to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional
    splicing-based RNA velocity analyses to enable accurate velocity estimations on
    a metabolically labeled human hematopoiesis scRNA-seq dataset. Furthermore, differential
    geometry analyses reveal mechanisms driving early megakaryocyte appearance and
    elucidate asymmetrical regulation within the PU.1-GATA1 circuit. Leveraging the
    least-action-path method, dynamo accurately predicts drivers of numerous hematopoietic
    transitions. Finally, in silico perturbations predict cell-fate diversions induced
    by gene perturbations. Dynamo, thus, represents an important step in advancing
    quantitative and predictive theories of cell-state transitions.

  abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells is initiated by the binding of the
    viral Spike protein to its cell-surface receptor ACE2. We conducted a targeted
    CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding
    to human cells. Here we show that the protein BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription
    in human lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently
    evaluated in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2
    infection of human cells, including those of human nasal epithelia. Moreover,
    pharmacological BRD2 inhibition with the drug ABBV-744 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication
    in Syrian hamsters. We also found that BRD2 controls transcription of several
    other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response,
    which in turn regulates the antiviral response. Together, our results pinpoint
    BRD2 as a potent and essential regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
    and highlight the potential of BRD2 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19.

  abstract: Omics-based technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the
    coding potential of the genome. In particular, these studies revealed widespread
    unannotated open reading frames (ORFs) throughout genomes and that these regions
    have the potential to encode novel functional (micro-)proteins and/or hold regulatory
    roles. However, despite their genomic prevalence, relatively few of these noncanonical
    ORFs have been functionally characterized, likely in part due to their under-recognition
    by the broader scientific community. The few that have been investigated in detail
    have demonstrated their essentiality in critical and divergent biological processes.
    As such, here we aim to discuss recent advances in understanding the diversity
    of noncanonical ORFs and their roles, as well as detail biologically important
    examples within the context of the mammalian genome.

  abstract: Understanding how viral and host factors interact and how perturbations
    impact infection is the basis for designing antiviral interventions. Here we define
    the functional contribution of each viral and host factor involved in human cytomegalovirus
    infection in primary human fibroblasts through pooled CRISPR interference and
    nuclease screening. To determine how genetic perturbation of critical host and
    viral factors alters the timing, course and progression of infection, we applied
    Perturb-seq to record the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of CRISPR-modified
    single cells and found that, normally, most cells follow a stereotypical transcriptional
    trajectory. Perturbing critical host factors does not change the stereotypical
    transcriptional trajectory per se but can stall, delay or accelerate progression
    along the trajectory, allowing one to pinpoint the stage of infection at which
    host factors act. Conversely, perturbation of viral factors can create distinct,
    abortive trajectories. Our results reveal the roles of host and viral factors
    and provide a roadmap for the dissection of host-pathogen interactions.

  abstract: Cells repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through a complex set of
    pathways critical for maintaining genomic integrity. To systematically map these
    pathways, we developed a high-throughput screening approach called Repair-seq
    that measures the effects of thousands of genetic perturbations on mutations introduced
    at targeted DNA lesions. Using Repair-seq, we profiled DSB repair products induced
    by two programmable nucleases (Cas9 and Cas12a) in the presence or absence of
    oligonucleotides for homology-directed repair (HDR) after knockdown of 476 genes
    involved in DSB repair or associated processes. The resulting data enabled principled,
    data-driven inference of DSB end joining and HDR pathways. Systematic interrogation
    of this data uncovered unexpected relationships among DSB repair genes and demonstrated
    that repair outcomes with superficially similar sequence architectures can have
    markedly different genetic dependencies. This work provides a foundation for mapping
    DNA repair pathways and for optimizing genome editing across diverse modalities.

  abstract: While prime editing enables precise sequence changes in DNA, cellular
    determinants of prime editing remain poorly understood. Using pooled CRISPRi screens,
    we discovered that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) impedes prime editing and promotes
    undesired indel byproducts. We developed PE4 and PE5 prime editing systems in
    which transient expression of an engineered MMR-inhibiting protein enhances the
    efficiency of substitution, small insertion, and small deletion prime edits by
    an average 7.7-fold and 2.0-fold compared to PE2 and PE3 systems, respectively,
    while improving edit/indel ratios by 3.4-fold in MMR-proficient cell types. Strategic
    installation of silent mutations near the intended edit can enhance prime editing
    outcomes by evading MMR. Prime editor protein optimization resulted in a PEmax
    architecture that enhances editing efficacy by 2.8-fold on average in HeLa cells.
    These findings enrich our understanding of prime editing and establish prime editing
    systems that show substantial improvement across 191 edits in seven mammalian
    cell types.

  abstract: The human genome encodes tens of thousands circular RNAs (circRNAs) with
    mostly unknown functions. Circular RNAs require internal ribosome entry sites
    (IRES) if they are to undergo translation without a 5' cap. Here, we develop a
    high-throughput screen to systematically discover RNA sequences that can direct
    circRNA translation in human cells. We identify more than 17,000 endogenous and
    synthetic sequences as candidate circRNA IRES. 18S rRNA complementarity and a
    structured RNA element positioned on the IRES are important for driving circRNA
    translation. Ribosome profiling and peptidomic analyses show extensive IRES-ribosome
    association, hundreds of circRNA-encoded proteins with tissue-specific distribution,
    and antigen presentation. We find that circFGFR1p, a protein encoded by circFGFR1
    that is downregulated in cancer, functions as a negative regulator of FGFR1 oncoprotein
    to suppress cell growth during stress. Systematic identification of circRNA IRES
    elements may provide important links among circRNA regulation, biological function,
    and disease.

  abstract: The trafficking of specific protein cohorts to correct subcellular locations
    at correct times is essential for every signaling and regulatory process in biology.
    Gene perturbation screens could provide a powerful approach to probe the molecular
    mechanisms of protein trafficking, but only if protein localization or mislocalization
    can be tied to a simple and robust phenotype for cell selection, such as cell
    proliferation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To empower the study
    of protein trafficking processes with gene perturbation, we developed a genetically
    encoded molecular tool named HiLITR (High-throughput Localization Indicator with
    Transcriptional Readout). HiLITR converts protein colocalization into proteolytic
    release of a membrane-anchored transcription factor, which drives the expression
    of a chosen reporter gene. Using HiLITR in combination with FACS-based CRISPRi
    screening in human cell lines, we identified genes that influence the trafficking
    of mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored proteins. We show that loss of the SUMO
    E1 component SAE1 results in mislocalization and destabilization of many mitochondrial
    tail-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate a distinct regulatory role for EMC10
    in the ER membrane complex, opposing the transmembrane-domain insertion activity
    of the complex. Through transcriptional integration of complex cellular functions,
    HiLITR expands the scope of biological processes that can be studied by genetic
    perturbation screening technologies.

  abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) regulate processes ranging from antitumor and antiviral
    immunity to host-microbe communication at mucosal surfaces. It remains difficult,
    however, to genetically manipulate human DCs, limiting our ability to probe how
    DCs elicit specific immune responses. Here, we develop a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing
    method for human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) that mediates knockouts with a median
    efficiency of >94% across >300 genes. Using this method, we perform genetic screens
    in moDCs, identifying mechanisms by which DCs tune responses to lipopolysaccharides
    from the human microbiome. In addition, we reveal donor-specific responses to
    lipopolysaccharides, underscoring the importance of assessing immune phenotypes
    in donor-derived cells, and identify candidate genes that control this specificity,
    highlighting the potential of our method to pinpoint determinants of inter-individual
    variation in immunity. Our work sets the stage for a systematic dissection of
    the immune signaling at the host-microbiome interface and for targeted engineering
    of DCs for neoantigen vaccination.

  abstract: A general approach for heritably altering gene expression has the potential
    to enable many discovery and therapeutic efforts. Here, we present CRISPRoff-a
    programmable epigenetic memory writer consisting of a single dead Cas9 fusion
    protein that establishes DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications.
    Transient CRISPRoff expression initiates highly specific DNA methylation and gene
    repression that is maintained through cell division and differentiation of stem
    cells to neurons. Pairing CRISPRoff with genome-wide screens and analysis of chromatin
    marks establishes rules for heritable gene silencing. We identify single guide
    RNAs (sgRNAs) capable of silencing the large majority of genes including those
    lacking canonical CpG islands (CGIs) and reveal a wide targeting window extending
    beyond annotated CGIs. The broad ability of CRISPRoff to initiate heritable gene
    silencing even outside of CGIs expands the canonical model of methylation-based
    silencing and enables diverse applications including genome-wide screens, multiplexed
    cell engineering, enhancer silencing, and mechanistic exploration of epigenetic
    inheritance.

    viral Spike protein to its cell-surface receptor ACE2. We conducted an unbiased
    CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding
    to human cells. We found that the protein BRD2 is an essential node in the cellular
    response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human
    lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated
    in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection
    of human cells. BRD2 also controls transcription of several other genes induced
    upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response, which in turn regulates
    ACE2 levels. It is possible that the previously reported interaction between the
    viral E protein and BRD2 evolved to manipulate the transcriptional host response
    during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results pinpoint BRD2 as a potent and
    essential regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight
    the potential of BRD2 as a novel therapeutic target for COVID-19.

  abstract: CRISPR-mediated interference (CRISPRi), a robust and specific system for
    programmably repressing transcription, provides a versatile tool for systematically
    characterizing the function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). When used with highly
    parallel, lentiviral pooled screening approaches, CRISPRi enables the targeted
    knockdown of tens of thousands of lncRNA-expressing loci in a single screen. Here
    we describe the use of CRISPRi to target lncRNA loci in a pooled screen, using
    cell growth and proliferation as an example of a phenotypic readout. Considerations
    for custom lncRNA-targeting libraries, alternative phenotypic readouts, and orthogonal
    validation approaches are also discussed.

  abstract: "Membrane protein biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is complex\
    \ and failure-prone. The ER membrane protein complex (EMC), comprising eight conserved\
    \ subunits, has emerged as a central player in this process. Yet, we have limited\
    \ understanding of how EMC enables insertion and integrity of diverse clients,\
    \ from tail-anchored to polytopic transmembrane proteins. Here, yeast and human\
    \ EMC cryo-EM structures reveal conserved intricate assemblies and human-specific\
    \ features associated with pathologies. Structure-based functional studies distinguish\
    \ between two separable EMC activities, as an insertase regulating tail-anchored\
    \ protein levels and a broader role in polytopic membrane protein biogenesis.\
    \ These depend on mechanistically coupled yet spatially distinct regions including\
    \ two lipid-accessible membrane cavities which confer client-specific regulation,\
    \ and a non-insertase EMC function mediated by the EMC lumenal domain. Our studies\
    \ illuminate the structural and mechanistic basis of EMC's multifunctionality\
    \ and point to its role in differentially regulating the biogenesis of distinct\
    \ client protein classes.\nCells are surrounded and contained by a plasma membrane\
    \ consisting of a double layer of fats and proteins. These proteins monitor and\
    \ facilitate the movement of food, oxygen and messages in and out of the cell,\
    \ and help neighboring cells communicate. Membrane proteins are manufactured in\
    \ a cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. Cellular machines called\
    \ ribosomes visit this compartment\u2019s membrane to manufacture proteins that\
    \ need to be secreted or embedded into the cell\u2019s membranes. As these proteins\
    \ are made, they are pulled into the endoplasmic reticulum so they can be folded\
    \ correctly and inserted in the membrane. A cellular machine in this compartment\u2019\
    s membrane that aids this process is the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein\
    \ complex (EMC). Many steps can go wrong during protein assembly, so to control\
    \ protein quality, the EMC has to accommodate the variety of complex physical\
    \ features that proteins can have. To explore the activity of the EMC, Miller-Vedam,\
    \ Br\xE4uning, Popova et al. studied the normal structure of the EMC in both yeast\
    \ and human cells grown in the lab. These snapshots of the complex in different\
    \ species had a lot in common, including how the complex was arranged within and\
    \ around the membrane. Next, Miller-Vedam, Br\xE4uning, Popova et al. generated\
    \ 50 mutant versions of the EMC in human cells to determine how changing different\
    \ parts of the complex affected the production of three proteins that rely on\
    \ the EMC to fold correctly. These proteins were an enzyme called squalene synthase,\
    \ a signaling protein called the beta adrenergic receptor and sigma intracellular\
    \ receptor 2, a protein involved in the regulation of cholesterol levels. Mutations\
    \ in the section of the EMC outside of the endoplasmic reticulum, within the main\
    \ cellular compartment, negatively impacted the stability of squalene synthase.\
    \ This section of the EMC provides a platform where proteins can associate before\
    \ entering the membrane. The part of EMC that spans the membrane contains both\
    \ a fat-filled cavity and a cavity with a \u2018door\u2019 that is either open\
    \ or closed. Mutations in this section disrupted the insertion of both squalene\
    \ synthase and the beta adrenergic receptor into the membrane, a role performed\
    \ by the cavity with the door. The specific role of the fat-filled cavity is still\
    \ not fully understood, but a mutation affecting this cavity disrupts the correct\
    \ production of all three proteins studied. The largest section of the complex,\
    \ which sits inside the endoplasmic reticulum, protected proteins as they folded,\
    \ ensuring they were not destroyed for being folded incorrectly before they were\
    \ fully formed. Mutations in this part of the EMC negatively impacted the stability\
    \ of sigma intracellular receptor 2 without negatively affecting the other proteins.\
    \ This molecular dissection of the activity of the EMC provides insights into\
    \ how membrane proteins are manufactured, stabilized, coordinated, and monitored\
    \ for quality. These findings could contribute towards the development of new\
    \ treatments for certain congenital diseases. For example, cystic fibrosis, retinitis\
    \ pigmentosa, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are all thought to be caused by\
    \ mutations within membrane proteins that require the EMC during their production."

  abstract: Sphingolipids play important roles in physiology and cell biology, but
    a systematic examination of their functions is lacking. We performed a genome-wide
    CRISPRi screen in sphingolipid-depleted human cells and identified hypersensitive
    mutants in genes of membrane trafficking and lipid biosynthesis, including ether
    lipid synthesis. Systematic lipidomic analysis showed a coordinate regulation
    of ether lipids with sphingolipids, suggesting an adaptation and functional compensation.
    Biophysical experiments on model membranes show common properties of these structurally
    diverse lipids that also share a known function as glycosylphosphatidylinositol
    (GPI) anchors in different kingdoms of life. Molecular dynamics simulations show
    a selective enrichment of ether phosphatidylcholine around p24 proteins, which
    are receptors for the export of GPI-anchored proteins and have been shown to bind
    a specific sphingomyelin species. Our results support a model of convergent evolution
    of proteins and lipids, based on their physico-chemical properties, to regulate
    GPI-anchored protein transport and maintain homeostasis in the early secretory
    pathway.

  abstract: Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits heterogeneity
    that enables adaptability, limits therapeutic success, and remains incompletely
    understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of metastatic lung cancer was
    performed using 49 clinical biopsies obtained from 30 patients before and during
    targeted therapy. Over 20,000 cancer and tumor microenvironment (TME) single-cell
    profiles exposed a rich and dynamic tumor ecosystem. scRNA-seq of cancer cells
    illuminated targetable oncogenes beyond those detected clinically. Cancer cells
    surviving therapy as residual disease (RD) expressed an alveolar-regenerative
    cell signature suggesting a therapy-induced primitive cell-state transition, whereas
    those present at on-therapy progressive disease (PD) upregulated kynurenine, plasminogen,
    and gap-junction pathways. Active T-lymphocytes and decreased macrophages were
    present at RD and immunosuppressive cell states characterized PD. Biological features
    revealed by scRNA-seq were biomarkers of clinical outcomes in independent cohorts.
    This study highlights how therapy-induced adaptation of the multi-cellular ecosystem
    of metastatic cancer shapes clinical outcomes.

    however, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We investigate the
    mechanism by which glucose restriction (GR) extends yeast replicative life span,
    by combining ribosome profiling and RNA-seq with microfluidic-based single-cell
    analysis. We discovered a cross-talk between glucose sensing and the regulation
    of intracellular methionine: GR down-regulated the transcription and translation
    of methionine biosynthetic enzymes and transporters, leading to a decreased intracellular
    methionine concentration; external supplementation of methionine cancels the life
    span extension by GR. Furthermore, genetic perturbations that decrease methionine
    synthesis/uptake extend life span. These observations suggest that intracellular
    methionine mediates the life span effects of various nutrient and genetic perturbations,
    and that the glucose-methionine cross-talk is a general mechanism for coordinating
    the nutrient status and the translation/growth of a cell. Our work also implicates

  abstract: Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathways protect cells from
    toxicity caused by incomplete protein products resulting from translation of damaged
    or problematic mRNAs. Extensive work in yeast has identified highly conserved
    mechanisms that lead to degradation of faulty mRNA and partially synthesized polypeptides.
    Here we used CRISPR-Cas9-based screening to search for additional RQC strategies
    in mammals. We found that failed translation leads to specific inhibition of translation
    initiation on that message. This negative feedback loop is mediated by two translation
    inhibitors, GIGYF2 and 4EHP. Model substrates and growth-based assays established
    that inhibition of additional rounds of translation acts in concert with known
    RQC pathways to prevent buildup of toxic proteins. Inability to block translation
    of faulty mRNAs and subsequent accumulation of partially synthesized polypeptides
    could explain the neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders observed in
    mice and humans with compromised GIGYF2 function.

  abstract: Efficient translational bypassing of a 50-nt non-coding gap in a phage
    T4 topoisomerase subunit gene (gp60) requires several recoding signals. Here we
    investigate the function of the mRNA stem-loop 5' of the take-off codon, as well
    as the importance of ribosome loading density on the mRNA for efficient bypassing.
    We show that polysomes are less efficient at mediating bypassing than monosomes,
    both in vitro and in vivo, due to their preventing formation of a stem-loop 5'
    of the take-off codon and allowing greater peptidyl-tRNA drop off. A ribosome
    profiling analysis of phage T4-infected Escherichia coli yielded protected mRNA
    fragments within the normal size range derived from ribosomes stalled at the take-off
    codon. However, ribosomes at this position also yielded some 53-nucleotide fragments,
    16 longer. These were due to protection of the nucleotides that form the 5' stem-loop.
    NMR shows that the 5' stem-loop is highly dynamic. The importance of different
    nucleotides in the 5' stem-loop is revealed by mutagenesis studies. These data
    highlight the significance of the 5' stem-loop for the 50-nt bypassing and further
    enhance appreciation of relevance of the extent of ribosome loading for recoding.

  abstract: The pairing of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing with massively parallel
    single-cell readouts now enables large-scale lineage tracing. However, the rapid
    growth in complexity of data from these assays has outpaced our ability to accurately
    infer phylogenetic relationships. First, we introduce Cassiopeia-a suite of scalable
    maximum parsimony approaches for tree reconstruction. Second, we provide a simulation
    framework for evaluating algorithms and exploring lineage tracer design principles.
    Finally, we generate the most complex experimental lineage tracing dataset to
    date, 34,557 human cells continuously traced over 15 generations, and use it for
    benchmarking phylogenetic inference approaches. We show that Cassiopeia outperforms
    traditional methods by several metrics and under a wide variety of parameter regimes,
    and provide insight into the principles for the design of improved Cas9-enabled
    recorders. Together, these should broadly enable large-scale mammalian lineage
    tracing efforts. Cassiopeia and its benchmarking resources are publicly available

  abstract: 'Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit highly cell type-specific expression
    and function, making this class of transcript attractive for targeted cancer therapy.
    However, the vast majority of lncRNAs have not been tested as potential therapeutic
    targets, particularly in the context of currently used cancer treatments. Malignant
    glioma is rapidly fatal, and ionizing radiation is part of the current standard-of-care
    used to slow tumor growth in both adult and pediatric patients.

    We use CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to screen 5689 lncRNA loci in human glioblastoma
    (GBM) cells, identifying 467 hits that modify cell growth in the presence of clinically
    relevant doses of fractionated radiation. Thirty-three of these lncRNA hits sensitize
    cells to radiation, and based on their expression in adult and pediatric gliomas,
    nine of these hits are prioritized as lncRNA Glioma Radiation Sensitizers (lncGRS).
    Knockdown of lncGRS-1, a primate-conserved, nuclear-enriched lncRNA, inhibits
    the growth and proliferation of primary adult and pediatric glioma cells, but

    of mature neural cell types as a three-dimensional tissue substrate to model the
    invasive growth of glioma, we find that antisense oligonucleotides targeting lncGRS-1
    selectively decrease tumor growth and sensitize glioma cells to radiation therapy.

    These studies identify lncGRS-1 as a glioma-specific therapeutic target and establish
    a generalizable approach to rapidly identify novel therapeutic targets in the
    vast non-coding genome to enhance radiation therapy.'

  abstract: Single-cell CRISPR screens enable the exploration of mammalian gene function
    and genetic regulatory networks. However, use of this technology has been limited
    by reliance on indirect indexing of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Here we present
    direct-capture Perturb-seq, a versatile screening approach in which expressed
    sgRNAs are sequenced alongside single-cell transcriptomes. Direct-capture Perturb-seq
    enables detection of multiple distinct sgRNA sequences from individual cells and
    thus allows pooled single-cell CRISPR screens to be easily paired with combinatorial
    perturbation libraries that contain dual-guide expression vectors. We demonstrate
    the utility of this approach for high-throughput investigations of genetic interactions
    and, leveraging this ability, dissect epistatic interactions between cholesterol
    biogenesis and DNA repair. Using direct capture Perturb-seq, we also show that
    targeting individual genes with multiple sgRNAs per cell improves efficacy of
    CRISPR interference and activation, facilitating the use of compact, highly active
    CRISPR libraries for single-cell screens. Last, we show that hybridization-based
    target enrichment permits sensitive, specific sequencing of informative transcripts
    from single-cell RNA-seq experiments.

  abstract: Ribosome profiling has revealed pervasive but largely uncharacterized
    translation outside of canonical coding sequences (CDSs). In this work, we exploit
    a systematic CRISPR-based screening strategy to identify hundreds of noncanonical
    CDSs that are essential for cellular growth and whose disruption elicits specific,
    robust transcriptomic and phenotypic changes in human cells. Functional characterization
    of the encoded microproteins reveals distinct cellular localizations, specific
    protein binding partners, and hundreds of microproteins that are presented by
    the human leukocyte antigen system. We find multiple microproteins encoded in
    upstream open reading frames, which form stable complexes with the main, canonical
    protein encoded on the same messenger RNA, thereby revealing the use of functional
    bicistronic operons in mammals. Together, our results point to a family of functional
    human microproteins that play critical and diverse cellular roles.

  abstract: A lack of tools to precisely control gene expression has limited our ability
    to evaluate relationships between expression levels and phenotypes. Here, we describe
    an approach to titrate expression of human genes using CRISPR interference and
    series of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with systematically modulated activities.
    We used large-scale measurements across multiple cell models to characterize activities
    of sgRNAs containing mismatches to their target sites and derived rules governing
    mismatched sgRNA activity using deep learning. These rules enabled us to synthesize
    a compact sgRNA library to titrate expression of ~2,400 genes essential for robust
    cell growth and to construct an in silico sgRNA library spanning the human genome.
    Staging cells along a continuum of gene expression levels combined with single-cell
    RNA-seq readout revealed sharp transitions in cellular behaviors at gene-specific
    expression thresholds. Our work provides a general tool to control gene expression,
    with applications ranging from tuning biochemical pathways to identifying suppressors
    for diseases of dysregulated gene expression.

  abstract: Flaviviruses translate their genomes as multi-pass transmembrane proteins
    at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Here, we show that the ER membrane
    protein complex (EMC) is indispensable for the expression of viral polyproteins.
    We demonstrated that EMC was essential for accurate folding and post-translational
    stability rather than translation efficiency. Specifically, we revealed degradation
    of NS4A-NS4B, a region rich in transmembrane domains, in absence of EMC. Orthogonally,
    by serial passaging of virus on EMC-deficient cells, we identified two non-synonymous
    point mutations in NS4A and NS4B, which rescued viral replication. Finally, we
    showed a physical interaction between EMC and viral NS4B and that the NS4A-4B
    region adopts an aberrant topology in the absence of the EMC leading to degradation.
    Together, our data highlight how flaviviruses hijack the EMC for transmembrane
    protein biogenesis to achieve optimal expression of their polyproteins, which
    reinforces a role for the EMC in stabilizing challenging transmembrane proteins
    during synthesis.

  abstract: Protein and membrane trafficking pathways are critical for cell and tissue
    homeostasis. Traditional genetic and biochemical approaches have shed light on
    basic principles underlying these processes. However, the list of factors required
    for secretory pathway function remains incomplete, and mechanisms involved in
    their adaptation poorly understood. Here, we present a powerful strategy based
    on a pooled genome-wide CRISPRi screen that allowed the identification of new
    factors involved in protein transport. Two newly identified factors, TTC17 and
    CCDC157, localized along the secretory pathway and were found to interact with
    resident proteins of ER-Golgi membranes. In addition, we uncovered that upon TTC17
    knockdown, the polarized organization of Golgi cisternae was altered, creating
    glycosylation defects, and that CCDC157 is an important factor for the fusion
    of transport carriers to Golgi membranes. In conclusion, our work identified and
    characterized new actors in the mechanisms of protein transport and secretion
    and opens stimulating perspectives for the use of our platform in physiological
    and pathological contexts.

    to the indeterminate relationship between self-renewal and differentiation, variation
    in progenitor field sizes, and internal gestation in these animals. Here we present
    a flexible, high-information, multi-channel molecular recorder with a single-cell
    readout and apply it as an evolving lineage tracer to assemble mouse cell-fate
    maps from fertilization through gastrulation. By combining lineage information
    with single-cell RNA sequencing profiles, we recapitulate canonical developmental
    relationships between different tissue types and reveal the nearly complete transcriptional
    convergence of endodermal cells of extra-embryonic and embryonic origins. Finally,
    we apply our cell-fate maps to estimate the number of embryonic progenitor cells
    and their degree of asymmetric partitioning during specification. Our approach
    enables massively parallel, high-resolution recording of lineage and other information
    in mammalian systems, which will facilitate the construction of a quantitative
    framework for understanding developmental processes.

  abstract: Regulation of the efficiency with which an mRNA is translated into proteins
    represents a key mechanism for controlling gene expression. Such regulation impacts
    the number of actively translating ribosomes per mRNA molecule, referred to as
    translation efficiency (TE), which can be monitored using ribosome profiling and
    RNA-seq, or by evaluating the position of an mRNA in a polysome gradient. Here
    we show that in budding yeast, under nutrient limiting conditions, the commonly
    used translation inhibitor cycloheximide induces rapid transcriptional upregulation
    of hundreds of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. Cycloheximide also prevents
    translation of these newly transcribed messages, leading to an apparent drop in
    TE of these genes under conditions that include key transitions during the yeast
    metabolic cycle, meiosis, and amino acid starvation; however, this effect is abolished
    when cycloheximide pretreatment is omitted. This response requires TORC1 signaling,
    and is modulated by the genetic background as well as the vehicle used to deliver
    the drug. The present work highlights an important caveat to the use of translation
    inhibitors when measuring TE or mRNA levels, and will hopefully aid in future
    experimental design as well as interpretation of prior results.

  abstract: Identifying small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by selectively
    stalling the ribosome constitutes a new strategy for therapeutic development.
    Compounds that inhibit the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density
    lipoprotein cholesterol, have been identified that reduce LDL cholesterol in preclinical
    models and that affect the translation of only a few off-target proteins. Although
    some of these compounds hold potential for future therapeutic development, it
    is not known how they impact the physiology of cells or ribosome quality control
    pathways. Here we used a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify proteins and pathways
    that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of a selective PCSK9 translational
    inhibitor, PF-06378503 (PF8503). The two most potent genetic modifiers of cell
    fitness in the presence of PF8503, the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase
    ASCC3, bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations
    of the compound. Surprisingly, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO)
    and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. In genetic interaction experiments,
    ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2, and functions downstream of HBS1L. Taken together,
    these results identify new connections between ribosome quality control pathways,
    and provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation
    that will aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling
    compounds to treat disease.

  abstract: Excessive levels of saturated fatty acids are toxic to cells, although
    the basis for this lipotoxicity remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed
    the transcriptome, lipidome, and genetic interactions of human leukemia cells
    exposed to palmitate. Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied
    by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic
    reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA
    (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously
    unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin
    ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity.
    On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes
    in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other lipid classes, are central to lipotoxicity
    in this model. Consistent with this, inhibition of ER-localized glycerol-3-phosphate
    acyltransferase activity protected from all aspects of lipotoxicity. Identification
    of genes modulating the response to saturated fatty acids may reveal novel therapeutic
    strategies for treating metabolic diseases linked to lipotoxicity.

  abstract: The translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein and the folding of
    the resulting protein into an active form are prerequisites for virtually every
    cellular process and represent the single largest investment of energy by cells.
    Ribosome profiling-based approaches have revolutionized our ability to monitor
    every step of protein synthesis in vivo, allowing one to measure the rate of protein
    synthesis across the proteome, annotate the protein coding capacity of genomes,
    monitor localized protein synthesis, and explore cotranslational folding and targeting.
    The rich and quantitative nature of ribosome profiling data provides an unprecedented
    opportunity to explore and model complex cellular processes. New analytical techniques
    and improved experimental protocols will provide a deeper understanding of the
    factors controlling translation speed and its impact on protein function and cell
    physiology as well as the role of ribosomal RNA and mRNA modifications in regulating
    translation.

  abstract: Seminal yeast studies have established the value of comprehensively mapping
    genetic interactions (GIs) for inferring gene function. Efforts in human cells
    using focused gene sets underscore the utility of this approach, but the feasibility
    of generating large-scale, diverse human GI maps remains unresolved. We developed
    a CRISPR interference platform for large-scale quantitative mapping of human GIs.
    We systematically perturbed 222,784 gene pairs in two cancer cell lines. The resultant
    maps cluster functionally related genes, assigning function to poorly characterized
    genes, including TMEM261, a new electron transport chain component. Individual
    GIs pinpoint unexpected relationships between pathways, exemplified by a specific
    cholesterol biosynthesis intermediate whose accumulation induces deoxynucleotide
    depletion, causing replicative DNA damage and a synthetic-lethal interaction with
    the ATR/9-1-1 DNA repair pathway. Our map provides a broad resource, establishes
    GI maps as a high-resolution tool for dissecting gene function, and serves as
    a blueprint for mapping the genetic landscape of human cells.

  abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports biosynthesis of proteins with
    diverse transmembrane domain (TMD) lengths and hydrophobicity. Features in transmembrane
    domains such as charged residues in ion channels are often functionally important,
    but could pose a challenge during cotranslational membrane insertion and folding.
    Our systematic proteomic approaches in both yeast and human cells revealed that
    the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) binds to and promotes the biogenesis of
    a range of multipass transmembrane proteins, with a particular enrichment for
    transporters. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC
    engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched
    for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation,
    which both protects clients from premature degradation and allows recruitment
    of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the
    biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features,
    thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.

  abstract: Spatial organization of phospholipid synthesis in eukaryotes is critical
    for cellular homeostasis. The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most
    abundant cellular phospholipid, occurs redundantly via the ER-localized Kennedy
    pathway and a pathway that traverses the ER and mitochondria via membrane contact
    sites. The basis of the ER-mitochondrial PC synthesis pathway is the exclusive
    mitochondrial localization of a key pathway enzyme, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase
    Psd1, which generates phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). We find that Psd1 is localized
    to both mitochondria and the ER. Our data indicate that Psd1-dependent PE made
    at mitochondria and the ER has separable cellular functions. In addition, the
    relative organellar localization of Psd1 is dynamically modulated based on metabolic
    needs. These data reveal a critical role for ER-localized Psd1 in cellular phospholipid
    homeostasis, question the significance of an ER-mitochondrial PC synthesis pathway
    to cellular phospholipid homeostasis, and establish the importance of fine spatial
    regulation of lipid biosynthesis for cellular functions.

  abstract: The recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell molecular
    profiling has catalyzed a growing sense in the scientific community that the time
    is ripe to complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the
    human body. The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort
    that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles
    (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical
    cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive
    reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel
    the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory
    circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding
    cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential
    utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human
    Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.

    mouse, cyclization recombination-inducible (Cre) CRISPRa system for cell type-specific

    animals by applying CRISPRa in a clinically relevant model of liver injury and
    repopulation. We targeted promoters of interest in regenerating hepatocytes using
    multiple single guide RNAs (gRNAs), and employed high-throughput sequencing to
    assess enrichment of gRNA sequences during liver repopulation and to link specific
    gRNAs to the initiation of carcinogenesis. All components of the CRISPRa system
    were expressed in a cell type-specific manner and activated endogenous gene expression
    in vivo. Multiple gRNA cassettes targeting a proto-oncogene were significantly
    enriched following liver repopulation, indicative of enhanced division of cells
    expressing the proto-oncogene. Furthermore, hepatocellular carcinomas developed
    containing gRNAs that activated this oncogene, indicative of cancer initiation
    events. Also, we employed our system for combinatorial cancer genetics in vivo
    as we found that while clonal hepatocellular carcinomas were dependent on the
    presence of the oncogene-inducing gRNAs, they were depleted for multiple gRNAs
    activating tumor suppressors.

    The in vivo CRISPRa platform developed here allows for parallel and combinatorial
    genetic screens in live animals; this approach enables screening for drivers and
    suppressors of cell replication and tumor initiation.'

  abstract: Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control
    complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized polypeptide for proteasomal
    degradation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC
    component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent polypeptide by adding a carboxyl-terminal
    alanine and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction. Here
    we examined the role of CAT-tailing in nascent-chain degradation in budding yeast.
    We found that Ltn1p efficiently accessed only nascent-chain lysines immediately
    proximal to the ribosome exit tunnel. For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible
    lysines, CAT-tailing enabled degradation by exposing lysines sequestered in the
    ribosome exit tunnel. Thus, CAT-tails do not serve as a degron, but rather provide
    a fail-safe mechanism that expands the range of RQC-degradable substrates.

  abstract: Bacterial mRNAs are organized into operons consisting of discrete open
    reading frames (ORFs) in a single polycistronic mRNA. Individual ORFs on the mRNA
    are differentially translated, with rates varying as much as 100-fold. The signals
    controlling differential translation are poorly understood. Our genome-wide mRNA
    secondary structure analysis indicated that operonic mRNAs are comprised of ORF-wide
    units of secondary structure that vary across ORF boundaries such that adjacent
    ORFs on the same mRNA molecule are structurally distinct. ORF translation rate
    is strongly correlated with its mRNA structure in vivo, and correlation persists,
    albeit in a reduced form, with its structure when translation is inhibited and
    with that of in vitro refolded mRNA. These data suggest that intrinsic ORF mRNA
    structure encodes a rough blueprint for translation efficiency. This structure
    is then amplified by translation, in a self-reinforcing loop, to provide the structure
    that ultimately specifies the translation of each ORF.

  abstract: We are just beginning to understand how translational control affects
    tumour initiation and malignancy. Here we use an epidermis-specific, in vivo ribosome
    profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape during the transition
    from normal homeostasis to malignancy. Using a mouse model of inducible SOX2,
    which is broadly expressed in oncogenic RAS-associated cancers, we show that despite
    widespread reductions in translation and protein synthesis, certain oncogenic
    mRNAs are spared. During tumour initiation, the translational apparatus is redirected
    towards unconventional upstream initiation sites, enhancing the translational
    efficiency of oncogenic mRNAs. An in vivo RNA interference screen of translational
    regulators revealed that depletion of conventional eIF2 complexes has adverse
    effects on normal but not oncogenic growth. Conversely, the alternative initiation
    factor eIF2A is essential for cancer progression, during which it mediates initiation
    at these upstream sites, differentially skewing translation and protein expression.

  abstract: In eukaryotes, protein kinase A (PKA) is a master regulator of cell proliferation
    and survival. The activity of PKA is subject to elaborate control and exhibits
    complex time dynamics. To probe the quantitative attributes of PKA dynamics in
    the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed an optogenetic strategy that
    uses a photoactivatable adenylate cyclase to achieve real-time regulation of cAMP
    and the PKA pathway. We capitalize on the precise and rapid control afforded by
    this optogenetic tool, together with quantitative computational modeling, to study
    the properties of feedback in the PKA signaling network and dissect the nonintuitive
    dynamic effects that ensue from perturbing its components. Our analyses reveal
    that negative feedback channeled through the Ras1/2 GTPase is delayed, pinpointing
    its time scale and its contribution to the dynamic features of the cAMP/PKA signaling
    network.

  abstract: The human genome produces thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-transcripts
    >200 nucleotides long that do not encode proteins. Although critical roles in
    normal biology and disease have been revealed for a subset of lncRNAs, the function
    of the vast majority remains untested. We developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)
    platform targeting 16,401 lncRNA loci in seven diverse cell lines, including six
    transformed cell lines and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Large-scale
    screening identified 499 lncRNA loci required for robust cellular growth, of which
    89% showed growth-modifying function exclusively in one cell type. We further
    found that lncRNA knockdown can perturb complex transcriptional networks in a
    cell type-specific manner. These data underscore the functional importance and
    cell type specificity of many lncRNAs.

  abstract: 'Next-generation sequencing (NGS) informs many biological questions with
    unprecedented depth and nucleotide resolution. These assays have created a need
    for analytical tools that enable users to manipulate data nucleotide-by-nucleotide
    robustly and easily. Furthermore, because many NGS assays encode information jointly
    within multiple properties of read alignments - for example, in ribosome profiling,
    the locations of ribosomes are jointly encoded in alignment coordinates and length
    - analytical tools are often required to extract the biological meaning from the
    alignments before analysis. Many assay-specific pipelines exist for this purpose,
    but there remains a need for user-friendly, generalized, nucleotide-resolution
    tools that are not limited to specific experimental regimes or analytical workflows.

    Plastid is a Python library designed specifically for nucleotide-resolution analysis
    of genomics and NGS data. As such, Plastid is designed to extract assay-specific
    information from read alignments while retaining generality and extensibility
    to novel NGS assays. Plastid represents NGS and other biological data as arrays
    of values associated with genomic or transcriptomic positions, and contains configurable
    tools to convert data from a variety of sources to such arrays. Plastid also includes
    numerous tools to manipulate even discontinuous genomic features, such as spliced
    transcripts, with nucleotide precision. Plastid automatically handles conversion
    between genomic and feature-centric coordinates, accounting for splicing and strand,
    freeing users of burdensome accounting. Finally, Plastid''s data models use consistent
    and familiar biological idioms, enabling even beginners to develop sophisticated
    analytical workflows with minimal effort.

    Plastid is a versatile toolkit that has been used to analyze data from multiple
    NGS assays, including RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and DMS-seq. It forms the genomic
    engine of our ORF annotation tool, ORF-RATER, and is readily adapted to novel
    NGS assays. Examples, tutorials, and extensive documentation can be found at https://plastid.readthedocs.io

  abstract: Coupling of structure-specific in vivo chemical modification to next-generation
    sequencing is transforming RNA secondary structure studies in living cells. The
    dominant strategy for detecting in vivo chemical modifications uses reverse transcriptase
    truncation products, which introduce biases and necessitate population-average
    assessments of RNA structure. Here we present dimethyl sulfate (DMS) mutational
    profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq), which encodes DMS modifications as mismatches
    using a thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase. DMS-MaPseq yields
    a high signal-to-noise ratio, can report multiple structural features per molecule,
    and allows both genome-wide studies and focused in vivo investigations of even
    low-abundance RNAs. We apply DMS-MaPseq for the first analysis of RNA structure
    within an animal tissue and to identify a functional structure involved in noncanonical
    translation initiation. Additionally, we use DMS-MaPseq to compare the in vivo
    structure of pre-mRNAs with their mature isoforms. These applications illustrate
    DMS-MaPseq's capacity to dramatically expand in vivo analysis of RNA structure.

  abstract: Progression of the Caulobacter cell cycle requires temporal and spatial
    control of gene expression, culminating in an asymmetric cell division yielding
    distinct daughter cells. To explore the contribution of translational control,
    RNA-seq and ribosome profiling were used to assay global transcription and translation
    levels of individual genes at six times over the cell cycle. Translational efficiency
    (TE) was used as a metric for the relative rate of protein production from each
    mRNA. TE profiles with similar cell cycle patterns were found across multiple
    clusters of genes, including those in operons or in subsets of operons. Collections
    of genes associated with central cell cycle functional modules (e.g., biosynthesis
    of stalk, flagellum, or chemotaxis machinery) have consistent but different TE
    temporal patterns, independent of their operon organization. Differential translation
    of operon-encoded genes facilitates precise cell cycle-timing for the dynamic
    assembly of multiprotein complexes, such as the flagellum and the stalk and the
    correct positioning of regulatory proteins to specific cell poles. The cell cycle-regulatory
    pathways that produce specific temporal TE patterns are separate from-but highly
    coordinated with-the transcriptional cell cycle circuitry, suggesting that the
    scheduling of translational regulation is organized by the same cyclical regulatory
    circuit that directs the transcriptional control of the Caulobacter cell cycle.

  abstract: We recently found that nucleosomes directly block access of CRISPR/Cas9
    to DNA (Horlbeck et al., 2016). Here, we build on this observation with a comprehensive
    algorithm that incorporates chromatin, position, and sequence features to accurately
    predict highly effective single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for targeting nuclease-dead
    Cas9-mediated transcriptional repression (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa). We
    use this algorithm to design next-generation genome-scale CRISPRi and CRISPRa
    libraries targeting human and mouse genomes. A CRISPRi screen for essential genes
    in K562 cells demonstrates that the large majority of sgRNAs are highly active.
    We also find CRISPRi does not exhibit any detectable non-specific toxicity recently
    observed with CRISPR nuclease approaches. Precision-recall analysis shows that
    we detect over 90% of essential genes with minimal false positives using a compact
    5 sgRNA/gene library. Our results establish CRISPRi and CRISPRa as premier tools
    for loss- or gain-of-function studies and provide a general strategy for identifying
    Cas9 target sites.

    \ protein 70 kDA (HSP70) for survival. HSP70-targeted therapy (but not chemotherapeutic\

  abstract: Cas9-based RNA-guided nuclease (RGN) has emerged to be a versatile method
    for genome editing due to the ease of construction of RGN reagents to target specific
    genomic sequences. The ability to control the activity of Cas9 with a high temporal
    resolution will facilitate tight regulation of genome editing processes for studying
    the dynamics of transcriptional regulation or epigenetic modifications in complex
    biological systems. Here we show that fusing ligand-binding domains of nuclear
    receptors to split Cas9 protein fragments can provide chemical control over split
    Cas9 activity. The method has allowed us to control Cas9 activity in a tunable
    manner with no significant background, which has been challenging for other inducible
    Cas9 constructs. We anticipate that our design will provide opportunities through
    the use of different ligand-binding domains to enable multiplexed genome regulation
    of endogenous genes in distinct loci through simultaneous chemical regulation
    of orthogonal Cas9 variants.

  abstract: Targeted transcriptional regulation is a powerful tool to study genetic
    mediators of cellular behavior. Here, we show that catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9)
    targeted to genomic regions upstream or downstream of the transcription start
    site allows for specific and sustainable gene-expression level alterations in
    tumor cells in vitro and in syngeneic immune-competent mouse models. We used this
    approach for a high-coverage pooled gene-activation screen in vivo and discovered
    previously unidentified modulators of tumor growth and therapeutic response. Moreover,
    by using dCas9 linked to an activation domain, we can either enhance or suppress
    target gene expression simply by changing the genetic location of dCas9 binding
    relative to the transcription start site. We demonstrate that these directed changes
    in gene-transcription levels occur with minimal off-target effects. Our findings
    highlight the use of dCas9-mediated transcriptional regulation as a versatile
    tool to reproducibly interrogate tumor phenotypes in vivo.

  abstract: 'Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts
    that can regulate molecular and cellular processes in brain development and disease.
    LncRNAs exhibit cell type- and tissue-specific expression, but little is known
    about the expression and function of lncRNAs in the developing human brain. Furthermore,
    it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are highly expressed in subsets of cells within
    tissues, despite appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations.

    We use strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from polyadenylated and
    total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development, and
    we apply this reference to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs
    are generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell transcriptomics
    of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed
    in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA
    enriched in single radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues.
    CRISPRi knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA regulates cell proliferation.

    The discrete and abundant expression of lncRNAs among individual cells has important
    implications for both their biological function and utility for distinguishing
    neural cell types.'

  abstract: The prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-associated
    protein, Cas9, has been widely adopted as a tool for editing, imaging, and regulating
    eukaryotic genomes. However, our understanding of how to select single-guide RNAs
    (sgRNAs) that mediate efficient Cas9 activity is incomplete, as we lack insight
    into how chromatin impacts Cas9 targeting. To address this gap, we analyzed large-scale
    genetic screens performed in human cell lines using either nuclease-active or
    nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9). We observed that highly active sgRNAs for Cas9 and
    dCas9 were found almost exclusively in regions of low nucleosome occupancy. In
    vitro experiments demonstrated that nucleosomes in fact directly impede Cas9 binding
    and cleavage, while chromatin remodeling can restore Cas9 access. Our results
    reveal a critical role of eukaryotic chromatin in dictating the targeting specificity
    of this transplanted bacterial enzyme, and provide rules for selecting Cas9 target
    sites distinct from and complementary to those based on sequence properties.

  abstract: Developing technologies for efficient and scalable disruption of gene
    expression will provide powerful tools for studying gene function, developmental
    pathways, and disease mechanisms. Here, we develop clustered regularly interspaced
    short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) to repress gene expression in
    human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). CRISPRi, in which a doxycycline-inducible
    deactivated Cas9 is fused to a KRAB repression domain, can specifically and reversibly
    inhibit gene expression in iPSCs and iPSC-derived cardiac progenitors, cardiomyocytes,
    and T lymphocytes. This gene repression system is tunable and has the potential
    to silence single alleles. Compared with CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn), CRISPRi gene
    repression is more efficient and homogenous across cell populations. The CRISPRi
    system in iPSCs provides a powerful platform to perform genome-scale screens in
    a wide range of iPSC-derived cell types, dissect developmental pathways, and model
    disease.

  abstract: A fundamental goal of genomics is to identify the complete set of expressed
    proteins. Automated annotation strategies rely on assumptions about protein-coding
    sequences (CDSs), e.g., they are conserved, do not overlap, and exceed a minimum
    length. However, an increasing number of newly discovered proteins violate these
    rules. Here we present an experimental and analytical framework, based on ribosome
    profiling and linear regression, for systematic identification and quantification
    of translation. Application of this approach to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
    mouse dendritic cells and HCMV-infected human fibroblasts identifies thousands
    of novel CDSs, including micropeptides and variants of known proteins, that bear
    the hallmarks of canonical translation and exhibit translation levels and dynamics
    comparable to that of annotated CDSs. Remarkably, many translation events are
    identified in both mouse and human cells even when the peptide sequence is not
    conserved. Our work thus reveals an unexpected complexity to mammalian translation
    suited to provide both conserved regulatory or protein-based functions.

  abstract: 'Eukaryotic cells are targeted by pathogenic viruses and have developed
    cell defense mechanisms against viral infection. In yeast, the cellular extrachromosomal
    genetic element [KIL-d] alters killer activity of M double-stranded RNA killer
    virus and confers cell resistance against the killer virus. However, its underlying

    that [KIL-d] is a proteinaceous prion-like aggregate with non-Mendelian cytoplasmic
    transmission. Deep sequencing analyses revealed that [KIL-d] selectively increases
    the rate of de novo mutation in the killer toxin gene of the viral genome, producing
    yeast harboring a defective mutant killer virus with a selective growth advantage
    over those with WT killer virus. These results suggest that a prion-like [KIL-d]

    in non-oncogene addiction to the proteostasis network that can be exploited clinically.
    The defining example is the exquisite sensitivity of multiple myeloma (MM) to
    20S proteasome inhibitors, such as carfilzomib. However, MM patients invariably
    acquire resistance to these drugs. Using a next-generation shRNA platform, we
    found that proteostasis factors, including chaperones and stress-response regulators,
    controlled the response to carfilzomib. Paradoxically, 19S proteasome regulator
    knockdown induced resistance to carfilzomib in MM and non-MM cells. 19S subunit
    knockdown did not affect the activity of the 20S subunits targeted by carfilzomib
    nor their inhibition by the drug, suggesting an alternative mechanism, such as
    the selective accumulation of protective factors. In MM patients, lower 19S levels
    predicted a diminished response to carfilzomib-based therapies. Together, our
    findings suggest that an understanding of network rewiring can inform development
    of new combination therapies to overcome drug resistance. '

  abstract: Passage through mitosis is driven by precisely-timed changes in transcriptional
    regulation and protein degradation. However, the importance of translational regulation
    during mitosis remains poorly understood. Here, using ribosome profiling, we find
    both a global translational repression and identified ~200 mRNAs that undergo
    specific translational regulation at mitotic entry. In contrast, few changes in
    mRNA abundance are observed, indicating that regulation of translation is the
    primary mechanism of modulating protein expression during mitosis. Interestingly,
    91% of the mRNAs that undergo gene-specific regulation in mitosis are translationally
    repressed, rather than activated. One of the most pronounced translationally-repressed
    genes is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC) which is degraded
    during mitosis. We show that full APC activation requires translational repression
    of Emi1 in addition to its degradation. These results identify gene-specific translational
    repression as a means of controlling the mitotic proteome, which may complement
    post-translational mechanisms for inactivating protein function.

    for postscreen sample preparation for deep sequencing. We present next-generation

  abstract: In Eukarya, stalled translation induces 40S dissociation and recruitment
    of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) to the 60S subunit, which mediates
    nascent chain degradation. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures
    revealing that the RQC components Rqc2p (YPL009C/Tae2) and Ltn1p (YMR247C/Rkr1)
    bind to the 60S subunit at sites exposed after 40S dissociation, placing the Ltn1p
    RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain near the exit channel and Rqc2p over
    the P-site transfer RNA (tRNA). We further demonstrate that Rqc2p recruits alanine-
    and threonine-charged tRNA to the A site and directs the elongation of nascent
    chains independently of mRNA or 40S subunits. Our work uncovers an unexpected
    mechanism of protein synthesis, in which a protein--not an mRNA--determines tRNA
    recruitment and the tagging of nascent chains with carboxy-terminal Ala and Thr
    extensions ("CAT tails").

  abstract: 'Ribosome profiling data report on the distribution of translating ribosomes,
    at steady-state, with codon-level resolution. We present a robust method to extract
    codon translation rates and protein synthesis rates from these data, and identify
    causal features associated with elongation and translation efficiency in physiological
    conditions in yeast. We show that neither elongation rate nor translational efficiency
    is improved by experimental manipulation of the abundance or body sequence of
    the rare AGG tRNA. Deletion of three of the four copies of the heavily used ACA
    tRNA shows a modest efficiency decrease that could be explained by other rate-reducing
    signals at gene start. This suggests that correlation between codon bias and efficiency
    arises as selection for codons to utilize translation machinery efficiently in
    highly translated genes. We also show a correlation between efficiency and RNA
    structure calculated both computationally and from recent structure probing data,
    as well as the Kozak initiation motif, which may comprise a mechanism to regulate
    initiation. '

  abstract: 'Eukaryotic cells execute complex transcriptional programs in which specific
    loci throughout the genome are regulated in distinct ways by targeted regulatory
    assemblies. We have applied this principle to generate synthetic CRISPR-based
    transcriptional programs in yeast and human cells. By extending guide RNAs to
    include effector protein recruitment sites, we construct modular scaffold RNAs
    that encode both target locus and regulatory action. Sets of scaffold RNAs can
    be used to generate synthetic multigene transcriptional programs in which some
    genes are activated and others are repressed. We apply this approach to flexibly
    redirect flux through a complex branched metabolic pathway in yeast. Moreover,
    these programs can be executed by inducing expression of the dCas9 protein, which
    acts as a single master regulatory control point. CRISPR-associated RNA scaffolds
    provide a powerful way to construct synthetic gene expression programs for a wide
    range of applications, including rewiring cell fates or engineering metabolic
    pathways. '

  abstract: 'Localized protein synthesis is a fundamental mechanism for creating distinct
    subcellular environments. Here we developed a generalizable proximity-specific
    ribosome profiling strategy that enables global analysis of translation in defined
    subcellular locations. We applied this approach to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
    in yeast and mammals. We observed the large majority of secretory proteins to
    be cotranslationally translocated, including substrates capable of posttranslational
    insertion in vitro. Distinct translocon complexes engaged nascent chains at different
    points during synthesis. Whereas most proteins engaged the ER immediately after
    or even before signal sequence (SS) emergence, a class of Sec66-dependent proteins
    entered with a looped SS conformation. Finally, we observed rapid ribosome exchange
    into the cytosol after translation termination. These data provide insights into
    how distinct translocation mechanisms act in concert to promote efficient cotranslational

  abstract: 'Nearly all mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded and are targeted
    to their mitochondrial destination from the cytosol. Here, we used proximity-specific
    ribosome profiling to comprehensively measure translation at the mitochondrial
    surface in yeast. Most inner-membrane proteins were cotranslationally targeted
    to mitochondria, reminiscent of proteins entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
    Comparison between mitochondrial and ER localization demonstrated that the vast
    majority of proteins were targeted to a specific organelle. A prominent exception
    was the fumarate reductase Osm1, known to reside in mitochondria. We identified
    a conserved ER isoform of Osm1, which contributes to the oxidative protein-folding
    capacity of the organelle. This dual localization was enabled by alternative translation
    initiation sites encoding distinct targeting signals. These findings highlight
    the exquisite in vivo specificity of organellar targeting mechanisms. '

  abstract: 'Macrolides are clinically important antibiotics thought to inhibit bacterial
    growth by impeding the passage of newly synthesized polypeptides through the nascent
    peptide exit tunnel of the bacterial ribosome. Recent data challenged this view
    by showing that macrolide antibiotics can differentially affect synthesis of individual
    proteins. To understand the general mechanism of macrolide action, we used genome-wide
    ribosome profiling and analyzed the redistribution of ribosomes translating highly
    expressed genes in bacterial cells treated with high concentrations of macrolide
    antibiotics. The metagene analysis indicated that inhibition of early rounds of
    translation, which would be characteristic of the conventional view of macrolide
    action, occurs only at a limited number of genes. Translation of most genes proceeds
    past the 5''-proximal codons and can be arrested at more distal codons when the
    ribosome encounters specific short sequence motifs. The problematic sequence motifs
    are confined to the nascent peptide residues in the peptidyl transferase center
    but not to the peptide segment that contacts the antibiotic molecule in the exit
    tunnel. Therefore, it appears that the general mode of macrolide action involves
    selective inhibition of peptide bond formation between specific combinations of
    donor and acceptor substrates. Additional factors operating in the living cell
    but not functioning during in vitro protein synthesis may modulate site-specific
    action of macrolide antibiotics. '

  abstract: 'Heritable differences in gene expression between individuals are an important
    source of phenotypic variation. The question of how closely the effects of genetic
    variation on protein levels mirror those on mRNA levels remains open. Here, we
    addressed this question by using ribosome profiling to examine how genetic differences
    between two strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae affect translation. Strain differences
    in translation were observed for hundreds of genes. Allele specific measurements
    in the diploid hybrid between the two strains revealed roughly half as many cis-acting
    effects on translation as were observed for mRNA levels. In both the parents and
    the hybrid, most effects on translation were of small magnitude, such that the
    direction of an mRNA difference was typically reflected in a concordant footprint
    difference. The relative importance of cis and trans acting variation on footprint
    levels was similar to that for mRNA levels. There was a tendency for translation
    to cause larger footprint differences than expected given the respective mRNA
    differences. This is in contrast to translational differences between yeast species
    that have been reported to more often oppose than reinforce mRNA differences.
    Finally, we catalogued instances of premature translation termination in the two
    yeast strains and also found several instances where erroneous reference gene
    annotations lead to apparent nonsense mutations that in fact reside outside of
    the translated gene body. Overall, genetic influences on translation subtly modulate
    gene expression differences, and translation does not create strong discrepancies
    between genetic influences on mRNA and protein levels. '

    the SunTag can recruit up to 24 copies of GFP, thereby enabling long-term imaging

    a potent synthetic transcription factor by recruiting multiple copies of a transcriptional

  abstract: 'We previously discovered a small-molecule inducer of cell death, named
    1541, that noncovalently self-assembles into chemical fibrils (''chemi-fibrils'')
    and activates procaspase-3 in vitro. We report here that 1541-induced cell death
    is caused by the fibrillar rather than the soluble form of the drug. A short hairpin
    RNA screen reveals that knockdown of genes involved in endocytosis, vesicle trafficking
    and lysosomal acidification causes partial 1541 resistance. We confirm the role
    of these pathways using pharmacological inhibitors. Microscopy shows that the
    fluorescent chemi-fibrils accumulate in punctae inside cells that partially colocalize
    with lysosomes. Notably, the chemi-fibrils bind and induce liposome leakage in
    vitro, suggesting they may do the same in cells. The chemi-fibrils induce extensive
    proteolysis including caspase substrates, yet modulatory profiling reveals that
    chemi-fibrils form a distinct class from existing inducers of cell death. The

    the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they
    occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here, we show hallmarks
    of translation in these footprints: copurification with the large ribosomal subunit,
    response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation
    at early AUGs. We develop a metric for distinguishing between 80S footprints and
    nonribosomal sources using footprint size distributions, which validates the vast
    majority of footprints outside of coding regions. We present evidence for polypeptide
    production beyond annotated genes, including the induction of immune responses
    following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Translation is pervasive on
    cytosolic transcripts outside of conserved reading frames, and direct detection
    of this expanded universe of translated products enables efforts at understanding

    transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely
    controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes
    are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional
    modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates
    of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These
    include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized
    for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances
    production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles,
    important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones,
    emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.

  abstract: Though sequence differences between alleles are often limited to a few
    polymorphisms, these differences can cause large and widespread allelic variation
    at the expression level. Such allele-specific expression (ASE) has been extensively
    explored at the level of transcription but not translation. Here we measured ASE
    in the diploid yeast Candida albicans at both the transcriptional and translational
    levels using RNA-seq and ribosome profiling, respectively. Since C. albicans is
    an obligate diploid, our analysis isolates ASE arising from cis elements in a
    natural, nonhybrid organism, where allelic effects reflect evolutionary forces.
    Importantly, we find that ASE arising from translation is of a similar magnitude
    as transcriptional ASE, both in terms of the number of genes affected and the
    magnitude of the bias. We further observe coordination between ASE at the levels
    of transcription and translation for single genes. Specifically, reinforcing relationships--where
    transcription and translation favor the same allele--are more frequent than expected
    by chance, consistent with selective pressure tuning ASE at multiple regulatory
    steps. Finally, we parameterize alleles based on a range of properties and find
    that SNP location and predicted mRNA-structure stability are associated with translational
    ASE in cis. Since this analysis probes more than 4000 allelic pairs spanning a
    broad range of variations, our data provide a genome-wide view into the relative
    impact of cis elements that regulate translation.

  abstract: 'Proteins are notorious for their unpleasant behavior-continually at risk
    of misfolding, collecting damage, aggregating, and causing toxicity and disease.
    To counter these challenges, cells have evolved elaborate chaperone and quality
    control networks that can resolve damage at the level of the protein, organelle,
    cell, or tissue. On the smallest scale, the integrity of individual proteins is
    monitored during their synthesis. On a larger scale, cells use compartmentalized
    defenses and networks of communication, capable sometimes of signaling between
    cells, to respond to changes in the proteome''s health. Together, these layered
    defenses help protect cells from damaged proteins. '

  abstract: 'Productive herpesvirus infection requires a profound, time-controlled
    remodeling of the viral transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the
    genomic architecture and gene expression control in Kaposi''s sarcoma-associated
    herpesvirus (KSHV), we performed a systematic genome-wide survey of viral transcriptional
    and translational activity throughout the lytic cycle. Using mRNA-sequencing and
    ribosome profiling, we found that transcripts encoding lytic genes are promptly
    bound by ribosomes upon lytic reactivation, suggesting their regulation is mainly
    transcriptional. Our approach also uncovered new genomic features such as ribosome
    occupancy of viral non-coding RNAs, numerous upstream and small open reading frames
    (ORFs), and unusual strategies to expand the virus coding repertoire that include
    alternative splicing, dynamic viral mRNA editing, and the use of alternative translation
    initiation codons. Furthermore, we provide a refined and expanded annotation of
    transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites, splice junctions, and initiation/termination
    codons of known and new viral features in the KSHV genomic space which we have

  abstract: 'RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector
    of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA''s ability to adopt
    complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational
    and experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for
    evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the
    thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to
    predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins
    and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside
    cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native
    conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in
    vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine
    and cytosine residues, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our
    data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger
    RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that
    in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo
    than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells,
    highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure.
    Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows
    that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded
    state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis
    of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view
    of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically
    favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure

  abstract: 'Ribosomes can read through stop codons in a regulated manner, elongating
    rather than terminating the nascent peptide. Stop codon readthrough is essential
    to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes
    in Drosophila melanogaster, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes
    remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep
    sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for Drosophila melanogaster,
    and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough
    is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved

    C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular
    localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance.
    We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough

  abstract: 'Many cellular processes operate in an "analog" regime in which the magnitude
    of the response is precisely tailored to the intensity of the stimulus. In order
    to maintain the coherence of such responses, the cell must provide for proportional
    expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of induction states.
    Our understanding of the strategies used to achieve graded gene regulation is
    limited.

    In this work, we document a relationship between stress-responsive gene expression
    and the transcription factor Msn2 that is graded over a large range of Msn2 concentrations.
    We use computational modeling and in vivo and in vitro analyses to dissect the
    roots of this relationship. Our studies reveal a simple and general strategy based
    on noncooperative low-affinity interactions between Msn2 and its cognate binding
    sites as well as competition over a large number of Msn2 binding sites in the
    genome relative to the number of Msn2 molecules.

    In addition to enabling precise tuning of gene expression to the state of the
    environment, this strategy ensures colinear activation of target genes, allowing
    for stoichiometric expression of large groups of genes without extensive promoter
    tuning. Furthermore, such a strategy enables precise modulation of the activity
    of any given promoter by addition of binding sites without altering the qualitative
    relationship between different genes in a regulon. This feature renders a given
    regulon highly "evolvable."'

    events central to cancer treatment. As a model we study myeloma cells exposed
    to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line therapy. Despite robust transcriptional
    changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical

    the resulting factor-RNC adducts are nuclease-treated to generate monosomes, and
    then they are affinity purified. The ribosome-extracted mRNA footprints are converted
    to DNA libraries for deep sequencing. The protocol is specified for general RP

  abstract: 'Sequence-specific control of gene expression on a genome-wide scale is
    an important approach for understanding gene functions and for engineering genetic
    regulatory systems. We have recently described an RNA-based method, CRISPR interference
    (CRISPRi), for targeted silencing of transcription in bacteria and human cells.
    The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR (clustered
    regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) pathway, requiring only the coexpression
    of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA).
    The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements complementary to the sgRNA and causes
    a steric block that halts transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in
    the repression of the target gene. Here we provide a protocol for the design,
    construction and expression of customized sgRNAs for transcriptional repression
    of any gene of interest. We also provide details for testing the repression activity
    of CRISPRi using quantitative fluorescence assays and native elongating transcript
    sequencing. CRISPRi provides a simplified approach for rapid gene repression within
    1-2 weeks. The method can also be adapted for high-throughput interrogation of
    genome-wide gene functions and genetic interactions, thus providing a complementary

    homologous chromosomes have not been completely resolved.

    We construct a phased diploid genome assembly by deep sequencing a standard laboratory
    wild-type strain and a panel of strains homozygous for particular chromosomes.
    The assembly has 700-fold coverage on average,allowing extensive revision and
    expansion of the number of known SNPs and indels. This phased genome significantly
    enhances the sensitivity and specificity of allele-specific expression measurements
    by enabling pooling and cross-validation of signal across multiple polymorphic
    sites. Additionally, the diploid assembly reveals pervasive and unexpected patterns
    in allelic differences between homologous chromosomes. Firstly, we see striking
    clustering of indels, concentrated primarily in the repeat sequences in promoters.
    Secondly, both indels and their repeat-sequence substrate are enriched near replication
    origins. Finally, we reveal an intimate link between repeat sequences and indels,
    which argues that repeat length is under selective pressure for most eukaryotes.
    This connection is described by a concise one-parameter model that explains repeat-sequence
    abundance in C. albicans as a function of the indel rate,and provides a general
    framework to interpret repeat abundance in species ranging from bacteria to humans.

    The phased genome assembly and insights into repeat plasticity will be valuable

    define a metric based on the known property of translation whereby translating

  abstract: A major challenge of the postgenomic era is to understand how human genes
    function together in normal and disease states. In microorganisms, high-density
    genetic interaction (GI) maps are a powerful tool to elucidate gene functions
    and pathways. We have developed an integrated methodology based on pooled shRNA
    screening in mammalian cells for genome-wide identification of genes with relevant
    phenotypes and systematic mapping of all GIs among them. We recently demonstrated
    the potential of this approach in an application to pathways controlling the susceptibility
    of human cells to the toxin ricin. Here we present the complete quantitative framework
    underlying our strategy, including experimental design, derivation of quantitative
    phenotypes from pooled screens, robust identification of hit genes using ultra-complex
    shRNA libraries, parallel measurement of tens of thousands of GIs from a single
    double-shRNA experiment, and construction of GI maps. We describe the general
    applicability of our strategy. Our pooled approach enables rapid screening of
    the same shRNA library in different cell lines and under different conditions
    to determine a range of different phenotypes. We illustrate this strategy here
    for single- and double-shRNA libraries. We compare the roles of genes for susceptibility
    to ricin and Shiga toxin in different human cell lines and reveal both toxin-specific
    and cell line-specific pathways. We also present GI maps based on growth and ricin-resistance
    phenotypes, and we demonstrate how such a comparative GI mapping strategy enables
    functional dissection of physical complexes and context-dependent pathways.

  abstract: 'Ribosome profiling is a new technique that allows monitoring locations
    of translating ribosomes on mRNA at a whole transcriptome level. A recent ribosome
    profiling study demonstrated that internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences have
    a major global effect on translation rates in bacteria: ribosomes pause at SD
    sites in mRNA. Therefore, it is important to understand how SD sites effect mRNA
    movement through the ribosome and generation of ribosome footprints.

    Here, we provide evidence that in addition to pausing effect, internal SD sequences
    induce a caterpillar-like movement of mRNA through the ribosome cavity. Once an
    SD site binds to the ribosome, it remains attached to it while the ribosome decodes
    a few subsequent codons. This leads to asymmetric progressive elongation of ribosome
    footprints at the 3''-end. It is likely that internal SD sequences induce a pause
    not on a single, but on several adjacent codons. This finding is important for
    our understanding of mRNA movement through the ribosome and also should facilitate
    interpretation of ribosome profiling data.'

  abstract: Aneuploidy, a chromosome content that is not a multiple of the haploid
    karyotype, is associated with reduced fitness in all organisms analyzed to date.
    In budding yeast aneuploidy causes cell proliferation defects, with many different
    aneuploid strains exhibiting a delay in G1, a cell cycle stage governed by extracellular
    cues, growth rate, and cell cycle events. Here we characterize this G1 delay.
    We show that 10 of 14 aneuploid yeast strains exhibit a growth defect during G1.
    Furthermore, 10 of 14 aneuploid strains display a cell cycle entry delay that
    correlates with the size of the additional chromosome. This cell cycle entry delay
    is due to a delayed accumulation of G1 cyclins that can be suppressed by supplying
    cells with high levels of a G1 cyclin. Our results indicate that aneuploidy frequently
    interferes with the ability of cells to grow and, as with many other cellular
    stresses, entry into the cell cycle.

  abstract: Genetic interaction (GI) maps, comprising pairwise measures of how strongly
    the function of one gene depends on the presence of a second, have enabled the
    systematic exploration of gene function in microorganisms. Here, we present a
    two-stage strategy to construct high-density GI maps in mammalian cells. First,
    we use ultracomplex pooled shRNA libraries (25 shRNAs/gene) to identify high-confidence
    hit genes for a given phenotype and effective shRNAs. We then construct double-shRNA
    libraries from these to systematically measure GIs between hits. A GI map focused
    on ricin susceptibility broadly recapitulates known pathways and provides many
    unexpected insights. These include a noncanonical role for COPI, a previously
    uncharacterized protein complex affecting toxin clearance, a specialized role
    for the ribosomal protein RPS25, and functionally distinct mammalian TRAPP complexes.
    The ability to rapidly generate mammalian GI maps provides a potentially transformative
    tool for defining gene function and designing combination therapies based on synergistic
    pairs.

  abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex organelle responsible for
    a range of functions including protein folding and secretion, lipid biosynthesis,
    and ion homeostasis. Despite its central and essential roles in eukaryotic cells
    during development, growth, and disease, many ER proteins are poorly characterized.
    Moreover, the range of biochemical reactions that occur within the ER membranes,
    let alone how these different activities are coordinated, is not yet defined.
    In recent years, focused studies on specific ER functions have been complemented
    by systematic approaches and innovative technologies for high-throughput analysis
    of the location, levels, and biological impact of given components. This article
    focuses on the recent progress of these efforts, largely pioneered in the budding
    yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and also addresses how future systematic studies
    can be geared to uncover the "dark matter" of uncharted ER functions.

  abstract: The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome was sequenced 20 years ago. However,
    like those of other complex viruses, our understanding of its protein coding potential
    is far from complete. We used ribosome profiling and transcript analysis to experimentally
    define the HCMV translation products and follow their temporal expression. We
    identified hundreds of previously unidentified open reading frames and confirmed
    a fraction by means of mass spectrometry. We found that regulated use of alternative
    transcript start sites plays a broad role in enabling tight temporal control of
    HCMV protein expression and allowing multiple distinct polypeptides to be generated
    from a single genomic locus. Our results reveal an unanticipated complexity to
    the HCMV coding capacity and illustrate the role of regulated changes in transcript
    start sites in generating this complexity.

    a key sensor of proteotoxic and other stress in the eukaryotic cytosol. We surveyed
    Hsf1 activity in a genome-wide loss-of-function library in Saccaromyces cerevisiae
    as well as ~78,000 double mutants and found Hsf1 activity to be modulated by highly
    diverse stresses. These included disruption of a ribosome-bound complex we named
    the Ribosome Quality Control Complex (RQC) comprising the Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase,
    two highly conserved but poorly characterized proteins (Tae2 and Rqc1), and Cdc48
    and its cofactors. Electron microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that
    the RQC forms a stable complex with 60S ribosomal subunits containing stalled
    polypeptides and triggers their degradation. A negative feedback loop regulates
    the RQC, and Hsf1 senses an RQC-mediated translation-stress signal distinctly
    from other stresses. Our work reveals the range of stresses Hsf1 monitors and
    elucidates a conserved cotranslational protein quality control mechanism.

  abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of translational control in determining
    protein abundance, underscoring the value of measuring gene expression at the
    level of translation. We present a protocol for genome-wide, quantitative analysis
    of in vivo translation by deep sequencing. This ribosome profiling approach maps
    the exact positions of ribosomes on transcripts by nuclease footprinting. The
    nuclease-protected mRNA fragments are converted into a DNA library suitable for
    deep sequencing using a strategy that minimizes bias. The abundance of different
    footprint fragments in deep sequencing data reports on the amount of translation
    of a gene. In addition, footprints reveal the exact regions of the transcriptome
    that are translated. To better define translated reading frames, we describe an
    adaptation that reveals the sites of translation initiation by pretreating cells
    with harringtonine to immobilize initiating ribosomes. The protocol we describe
    requires 5-7 days to generate a completed ribosome profiling sequencing library.
    Sequencing and data analysis require a further 4-5 days.

  abstract: Novel protein-coding genes can arise either through re-organization of
    pre-existing genes or de novo. Processes involving re-organization of pre-existing
    genes, notably after gene duplication, have been extensively described. In contrast,
    de novo gene birth remains poorly understood, mainly because translation of sequences
    devoid of genes, or 'non-genic' sequences, is expected to produce insignificant
    polypeptides rather than proteins with specific biological functions. Here we
    formalize an evolutionary model according to which functional genes evolve de
    novo through transitory proto-genes generated by widespread translational activity
    in non-genic sequences. Testing this model at the genome scale in Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae, we detect translation of hundreds of short species-specific open reading
    frames (ORFs) located in non-genic sequences. These translation events seem to
    provide adaptive potential, as suggested by their differential regulation upon
    stress and by signatures of retention by natural selection. In line with our model,
    we establish that S. cerevisiae ORFs can be placed within an evolutionary continuum
    ranging from non-genic sequences to genes. We identify ~1,900 candidate proto-genes
    among S. cerevisiae ORFs and find that de novo gene birth from such a reservoir
    may be more prevalent than sporadic gene duplication. Our work illustrates that
    evolution exploits seemingly dispensable sequences to generate adaptive functional
    innovation.

  abstract: Advances in sequencing technology have led to the development of many

    This unit describes such an approach, native elongating transcript sequencing
    (NET-seq), which reveals the density of RNA polymerase across the Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae genome with single-nucleotide resolution. A procedure for capturing
    nascent RNA transcripts directly from live cells through their association with
    the DNA-RNA-RNAP ternary complex is described. A protocol to create DNA libraries
    from the nascent RNA, allowing the identity and abundance of the 3' end of purified
    transcripts to be revealed by next generation sequencing, is also provided. By
    deep sequencing this DNA library, a quantitative measure of RNAP density with
    single-nucleotide precision is obtained. The quantitative nature of the NET-seq
    dataset relies on the high efficiency of many steps in the protocol. The steps
    that are most critical are described with suggestions for monitoring their success.

  abstract: Protein synthesis by ribosomes takes place on a linear substrate but at
    non-uniform speeds. Transient pausing of ribosomes can affect a variety of co-translational
    processes, including protein targeting and folding. These pauses are influenced
    by the sequence of the messenger RNA. Thus, redundancy in the genetic code allows
    the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of
    both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly
    limited. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of translational pausing in bacteria
    by ribosome profiling--deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. This
    approach enables the high-resolution measurement of ribosome density profiles
    along most transcripts at unperturbed, endogenous expression levels. Unexpectedly,
    we found that codons decoded by rare transfer RNAs do not lead to slow translation
    under nutrient-rich conditions. Instead, Shine-Dalgarno-(SD)-like features within
    coding sequences cause pervasive translational pausing. Using an orthogonal ribosome
    possessing an altered anti-SD sequence, we show that pausing is due to hybridization
    between the mRNA and 16S ribosomal RNA of the translating ribosome. In protein-coding
    sequences, internal SD sequences are disfavoured, which leads to biased usage,
    avoiding codons and codon pairs that resemble canonical SD sites. Our results
    indicate that internal SD-like sequences are a major determinant of translation
    rates and a global driving force for the coding of bacterial genomes.

    However, the downstream translationally regulated nodes of gene expression that

    we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic
    mTOR signalling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved
    in cell proliferation, metabolism and invasion. We extend these findings by functionally
    characterizing a class of translationally controlled pro-invasion messenger RNAs
    that we show direct prostate cancer invasion and metastasis downstream of oncogenic
    mTOR signalling. Furthermore, we develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor
    of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic
    benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure.
    Together, these findings extend our understanding of how the 'cancerous' translation

  abstract: Meiosis is a complex developmental process that generates haploid cells
    from diploid progenitors. We measured messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance and protein
    production through the yeast meiotic sporulation program and found strong, stage-specific
    expression for most genes, achieved through control of both mRNA levels and translational
    efficiency. Monitoring of protein production timing revealed uncharacterized recombination
    factors and extensive organellar remodeling. Meiotic translation is also shifted
    toward noncanonical sites, including short open reading frames (ORFs) on unannnotated
    transcripts and upstream regions of known transcripts (uORFs). Ribosome occupancy
    at near-cognate uORFs was associated with more efficient ORF translation; by contrast,
    some AUG uORFs, often exposed by regulated 5' leader extensions, acted competitively.
    This work reveals pervasive translational control in meiosis and helps to illuminate
    the molecular basis of the broad restructuring of meiotic cells.

  abstract: The Orm family proteins are conserved integral membrane proteins of the
    endoplasmic reticulum that are key homeostatic regulators of sphingolipid biosynthesis.
    Orm proteins bind to and inhibit serine:palmitoyl-coenzyme A transferase, the
    first enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Orm1 and
    Orm2 are inactivated by phosphorylation in response to compromised sphingolipid
    synthesis (e.g., upon addition of inhibitor myriocin), thereby restoring sphingolipid
    production. We show here that protein kinase Ypk1, one of an essential pair of
    protein kinases, is responsible for this regulatory modification. Myriocin-induced
    hyperphosphorylation of Orm1 and Orm2 does not occur in ypk1 cells, and immunopurified
    Ypk1 phosphorylates Orm1 and Orm2 robustly in vitro exclusively on three residues
    that are known myriocin-induced sites. Furthermore, the temperature-sensitive
    growth of ypk1(ts) ypk2 cells is substantially ameliorated by deletion of ORM
    genes, confirming that a primary physiological role of Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation
    is to negatively regulate Orm function. Ypk1 immunoprecipitated from myriocin-treated
    cells displays a higher specific activity for Orm phosphorylation than Ypk1 from
    untreated cells. To identify the mechanism underlying Ypk1 activation, we systematically
    tested several candidate factors and found that the target of rapamycin complex
    2 (TORC2) kinase plays a key role. In agreement with prior evidence that a TORC2-dependent
    site in Ypk1(T662) is necessary for cells to exhibit a wild-type level of myriocin
    resistance, a Ypk1(T662A) mutant displays only weak Orm phosphorylation in vivo
    and only weak activation in vitro in response to sphingolipid depletion. Additionally,
    sphingolipid depletion increases phosphorylation of Ypk1 at T662. Thus, Ypk1 is
    both a sensor and effector of sphingolipid level, and reduction in sphingolipids
    stimulates Ypk1, at least in part, via TORC2-dependent phosphorylation.

  abstract: The ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering
    the information they encode. Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome
    profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide
    genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining
    rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to
    cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with
    a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis
    of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause
    sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions
    and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated
    at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation.
    We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs
    (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity
    to mammalian proteomes.

  abstract: To broadly explore mitochondrial structure and function as well as the
    communication of mitochondria with other cellular pathways, we constructed a quantitative,
    high-density genetic interaction map (the MITO-MAP) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
    The MITO-MAP provides a comprehensive view of mitochondrial function including
    insights into the activity of uncharacterized mitochondrial proteins and the functional
    connection between mitochondria and the ER. The MITO-MAP also reveals a large
    inner membrane-associated complex, which we term MitOS for mitochondrial organizing
    structure, comprised of Fcj1/Mitofilin, a conserved inner membrane protein, and
    five additional components. MitOS physically and functionally interacts with both
    outer and inner membrane components and localizes to extended structures that
    wrap around the inner membrane. We show that MitOS acts in concert with ATP synthase
    dimers to organize the inner membrane and promote normal mitochondrial morphology.
    We propose that MitOS acts as a conserved mitochondrial skeletal structure that
    differentiates regions of the inner membrane to establish the normal internal
    architecture of mitochondria.

  abstract: "Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are obligate blood feeders that have\
    \ evolved specialized systems to suit their sanguinary lifestyle. Chief among\
    \ such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating\
    \ hotspots on warm-blooded prey. Among vertebrates, only vampire bats, boas, pythons\
    \ and pit vipers are capable of detecting infrared radiation. In each case, infrared\
    \ signals are detected by trigeminal nerve fibres that innervate specialized pit\
    \ organs on the animal's face. Thus, vampire bats and snakes have taken thermosensation\
    \ to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation.\
    \ As such, these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms\
    \ underlying evolutionary tuning of thermoreceptors in a species-specific or cell-type-specific\
    \ manner. Previously, we have shown that snakes co-opt a non-heat-sensitive channel,\
    \ vertebrate TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), to produce\
    \ an infrared detector. Here we show that vampire bats tune a channel that is\
    \ already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold\
    \ to about 30\u2009\xB0C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1\
    \ transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic\
    \ domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not\
    \ in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of\
    \ noxious heat in somatic afferents. This reflects a unique organization of the\
    \ bat Trpv1 gene that we show to be characteristic of Laurasiatheria mammals (cows,\
    \ dogs and moles), supporting a close phylogenetic relationship with bats. These\
    \ findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for physiological tuning of thermosensory\
    \ nerve fibres."

  abstract: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway mediates the termination
    of snoRNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). Both Nrd1 and the Set1 histone
    H3K4 methyltransferase complex interact with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during
    early elongation, leading us to test whether these two processes are functionally
    linked. The deletion of SET1 exacerbates the growth rate and termination defects
    of nrd1 mutants. Set1 is important for the appropriate recruitment of Nrd1. Additionally,
    Set1 modulates histone acetylation levels in the promoter-proximal region via
    the Rpd3L deacetylase and NuA3 acetyltransferase complexes, both of which contain
    PHD finger proteins that bind methylated H3K4. Increased levels of histone acetylation
    reduce the efficiency of Nrd1-dependent termination. We speculate that Set1 promotes
    proper early termination by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 complex by affecting the kinetics
    of Pol II transcription in early elongation.

  abstract: Prion proteins can adopt multiple infectious strain conformations. Here
    we investigate how the sequence of a prion protein affects its capacity to propagate
    specific conformations by exploiting our ability to create two distinct infectious
    conformations of the yeast [PSI(+)] prion protein Sup35, termed Sc4 and Sc37.
    PNM2, a G58D point mutant of Sup35 that was originally identified for its dominant
    interference with prion propagation, leads to rapid, recessive loss of Sc4 but
    does not interfere with propagation of Sc37. PNM2 destabilizes the amyloid core
    of Sc37 and causes compensatory effects that slow prion growth but aid prion division
    and result in robust propagation of Sc37. By contrast, PNM2 does not affect the
    structure or chaperone-mediated division of Sc4 but interferes with its delivery
    to daughter cells. Thus, effective delivery of infectious particles during cell
    division is a crucial and conformation-dependent step in prion inheritance.

  abstract: 'A remarkable feature of prion biology is that the same prion protein
    can misfold into more than one infectious conformation, and these conformations
    in turn lead to distinct heritable prion strains with different phenotypes. The
    yeast prion [PSI(+)] is a powerful system for studying how changes in strain conformation
    affect cross-species transmission. We have previously established that a chimera
    of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) and Candida albicans (CA) Sup35 prion domains
    can cross the SC/CA species barrier in a strain-dependent manner. In vitro, the
    conversion of the monomeric chimera into the prion (amyloid) form can be seeded
    by either SC or CA Sup35 amyloid fibers, resulting in two strains: Chim[SC] and
    Chim[CA]. These strains have a "molecular memory" of their originating species
    in that Chim[SC] preferentially seeds the conversion of SC Sup35, and vice versa.
    To investigate how this species specificity is conformationally encoded, we used
    amide exchange and limited proteolysis to probe the structures of these two strains.
    We found that the amyloid cores of Chim[SC] and Chim[CA] are predominantly confined
    to the SC-derived and CA-derived residues, respectively. In addition, the chimera
    is able to propagate the Chim[CA] conformation even when the SC residues comprising
    the Chim[SC] core were deleted. Thus, the two strains have non-overlapping and
    modular amyloid cores that determine whether SC or CA residues are presented on
    the growing face of the prion seed. These observations establish how conformations
    determine the specificity of prion transmission and demonstrate a remarkable plasticity
    to amyloid misfolding.'

  abstract: Recent studies of transcription have revealed a level of complexity not
    previously appreciated even a few years ago, both in the intricate use of post-initiation
    control and the mass production of rapidly degraded transcripts. Dissection of
    these pathways requires strategies for precisely following transcripts as they
    are being produced. Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript
    sequencing, NET-seq), based on deep sequencing of 3' ends of nascent transcripts
    associated with RNA polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution.
    Application of NET-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters
    are generally capable of divergent transcription, the Rpd3S deacetylation complex
    enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript
    initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking
    throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks
    at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good
    agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing
    represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo.

  abstract: The phosphate signal transduction (PHO) pathway, which regulates genes
    in response to phosphate starvation, is well defined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
    We asked whether the PHO pathway was the same in the distantly related fission
    yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We screened a deletion collection for mutants
    aberrant in phosphatase activity, which is primarily a consequence of pho1(+)
    transcription. We identified a novel zinc finger-containing protein (encoded by
    spbc27b12.11c(+)), which we have named pho7(+), that is essential for pho1(+)
    transcriptional induction during phosphate starvation. Few of the S. cerevisiae
    genes involved in the PHO pathway appear to be involved in the regulation of the
    phosphate starvation response in S. pombe. Only the most upstream genes in the
    PHO pathway in S. cerevisiae (ADO1, DDP1, and PPN1) share a similar role in both
    yeasts. Because ADO1 and DDP1 regulate ATP and IP(7) levels, we hypothesize that
    the ancestor of these yeasts must have sensed similar metabolites in response
    to phosphate starvation but have evolved distinct mechanisms in parallel to sense
    these metabolites and induce phosphate starvation genes.

  abstract: Sphingolipids and their metabolites play key cellular roles both as structural
    components of membranes and as signaling molecules that mediate responses to physiologic
    cues and stresses. Despite progress during the last two decades in defining the
    enzymatic machinery responsible for synthesizing and degrading sphingolipids,
    comparatively little is known about how these enzymes are regulated to ensure
    sphingolipid homeostasis. Here, we review new insights into how cells sense and
    control sphingolipid biosynthesis and transport. We also discuss emerging evidence
    that sphingolipid metabolism is closely coordinated with that of sterols and glycerolipids
    and with other processes that occur in the secretory pathway. An improved understanding
    of sphingolipid homeostasis promises to shed light on basic processes in cell
    biology and disease, including how cells establish and maintain the complex membrane
    composition and architecture that is a defining feature of eukaryotic cell biology.

  abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous approximately 22-nucleotide RNAs that
    mediate important gene-regulatory events by pairing to the mRNAs of protein-coding
    genes to direct their repression. Repression of these regulatory targets leads
    to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative
    contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for
    endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome
    profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these
    to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous
    miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (>/=84%) of
    the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels
    closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization
    of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.

  abstract: High-throughput quantitative genetic interaction (GI) measurements provide
    detailed information regarding the structure of the underlying biological pathways
    by reporting on functional dependencies between genes. However, the analytical
    tools for fully exploiting such information lag behind the ability to collect
    these data. We present a novel Bayesian learning method that uses quantitative
    phenotypes of double knockout organisms to automatically reconstruct detailed
    pathway structures. We applied our method to a recent data set that measures GIs
    for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) genes, using the unfolded protein response as a
    quantitative phenotype. The results provided reconstructions of known functional
    pathways including N-linked glycosylation and ER-associated protein degradation.
    It also contained novel relationships, such as the placement of SGT2 in the tail-anchored
    biogenesis pathway, a finding that we experimentally validated. Our approach should
    be readily applicable to the next generation of quantitative GI data sets, as
    assays become available for additional phenotypes and eventually higher-level
    organisms.

    variation leads to changes in the level of protein abundance. To address this,
    we eliminated one of the two genomic copies of 730 different genes in Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae and asked how often a 50% reduction in gene dosage leads to a 50% reduction
    in protein level. For at least 80% of genes tested, and under several environmental
    conditions, it does: protein levels in the heterozygous strain are close to 50%
    of wild type. For <5% of the genes tested, the protein levels in the heterozygote
    are maintained at nearly wild-type levels. These experiments show that protein
    levels are not, in general, directly monitored and adjusted to a desired level.
    Combined with fitness data, this implies that proteins are expressed at levels
    higher than necessary for survival.'

  abstract: Hsp70 chaperones can potentially interact with one of several J domain-containing
    Hsp40 co-chaperones to regulate distinct cellular processes. However, features
    within Hsp70s that determine Hsp40 specificity are undefined. To investigate this
    question, we introduced mutations into the ER-lumenal Hsp70, BiP/Kar2p, and found
    that an R217A substitution in the J domain-interacting surface of BiP compromised
    the physical and functional interaction with Sec63p, an Hsp40 required for ER
    translocation. In contrast, interaction with Jem1p, an Hsp40 required for ER-associated
    degradation, was unaffected. Moreover, yeast expressing R217A BiP exhibited defects
    in translocation but not in ER-associated degradation. Finally, the genetic interactions
    of the R217A BiP mutant were found to correlate with those of known translocation
    mutants. Together, our results indicate that residues within the Hsp70 J domain-interacting
    surface help confer Hsp40 specificity, in turn influencing distinct chaperone-mediated
    cellular activities.

  abstract: Snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation,
    enabling them to generate a 'thermal image' of predators or prey. Infrared signals
    are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure
    that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ
    detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here
    we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels
    as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1
    orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive
    vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary
    transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through
    a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical
    transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient
    receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.

  abstract: Despite the essential roles of sphingolipids both as structural components
    of membranes and critical signalling molecules, we have a limited understanding
    of how cells sense and regulate their levels. Here we reveal the function in sphingolipid
    metabolism of the ORM genes (known as ORMDL genes in humans)-a conserved gene
    family that includes ORMDL3, which has recently been identified as a potential
    risk factor for childhood asthma. Starting from an unbiased functional genomic
    approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identify Orm proteins as negative regulators
    of sphingolipid synthesis that form a conserved complex with serine palmitoyltransferase,
    the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid production. We also define
    a regulatory pathway in which phosphorylation of Orm proteins relieves their inhibitory
    activity when sphingolipid production is disrupted. Changes in ORM gene expression
    or mutations to their phosphorylation sites cause dysregulation of sphingolipid
    metabolism. Our work identifies the Orm proteins as critical mediators of sphingolipid
    homeostasis and raises the possibility that sphingolipid misregulation contributes
    to the development of childhood asthma.

  abstract: Aggregation-prone proteins often misfold into multiple distinct amyloid
    conformations that dictate different physiological impacts. Although amyloid formation
    is triggered by a transient nucleus, the mechanism by which an initial nucleus
    is formed and allows the protein to form a specific amyloid conformation has been
    unclear. Here we show that, before fiber formation, the prion domain (Sup35NM,
    consisting of residues 1-254) of yeast prion Sup35, the [PSI(+)] protein determinant,
    forms oligomers in a temperature-dependent, reversible manner. Mutational and
    biophysical analyses revealed that 'non-native' aromatic interactions outside
    the amyloid core drive oligomer formation by bringing together different Sup35NM
    monomers, which specifically leads to the formation of highly infectious strain
    conformations with more limited amyloid cores. Thus, transient non-native interactions
    in the initial nucleus are pivotal in determining the diversity of amyloid conformations
    and resulting prion strain phenotypes.

    the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding XBP-1 (X-box-binding protein 1), enabling splicing
    and production of this active transcription factor. We recently showed that Ire1
    activation independently induces the rapid turnover of mRNAs encoding membrane
    and secreted proteins in Drosophila melanogaster cells through a pathway we call
    regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD). In this study, we show that mouse fibroblasts
    expressing wild-type Ire1 but not an Ire1 variant lacking nuclease activity also
    degrade mRNAs in response to ER stress. Using a second variant of Ire1 that is
    activated by a small adenosine triphosphate analogue, we show that although XBP-1
    splicing can be artificially induced in the absence of ER stress, RIDD appears
    to require both Ire1 activity and ER stress. Our data suggest that cells use a
    multitiered mechanism by which different conditions in the ER lead to distinct
    outputs from Ire1.

  abstract: Communication between organelles is an important feature of all eukaryotic
    cells. To uncover components involved in mitochondria/endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
    junctions, we screened for mutants that could be complemented by a synthetic protein
    designed to artificially tether the two organelles. We identified the Mmm1/Mdm10/Mdm12/Mdm34
    complex as a molecular tether between ER and mitochondria. The tethering complex
    was composed of proteins resident of both ER and mitochondria. With the use of
    genome-wide mapping of genetic interactions, we showed that the components of
    the tethering complex were functionally connected to phospholipid biosynthesis
    and calcium-signaling genes. In mutant cells, phospholipid biosynthesis was impaired.
    The tethering complex localized to discrete foci, suggesting that discrete sites
    of close apposition between ER and mitochondria facilitate interorganelle calcium
    and phospholipid exchange.

  abstract: Short hairpin RNA libraries are limited by low efficacy of many shRNAs
    and by off-target effects, which give rise to false negatives and false positives,
    respectively. Here we present a strategy for rapidly creating expanded shRNA pools
    (approximately 30 shRNAs per gene) that are analyzed by deep sequencing (EXPAND).
    This approach enables identification of multiple effective target-specific shRNAs
    from a complex pool, allowing a rigorous statistical evaluation of true hits.

  abstract: Eukaryotic mRNAs are subject to quality control mechanisms that degrade
    defective mRNAs. In yeast, mRNAs with stalls in translation elongation are targeted
    for endonucleolytic cleavage by No-Go decay (NGD). The cleavage triggered by No-Go
    decay is dependent on Dom34p and Hbs1p, and Dom34 has been proposed to be the
    endonuclease responsible for mRNA cleavage. We created several Dom34 mutants and
    examined their effects on NGD in yeast. We identified mutations in several loops
    of the Dom34 structure that affect NGD. In contrast, mutations inactivating the
    proposed nuclease domain do not affect NGD in vivo. Moreover, we observed that
    overexpression of the Rps30a protein, a high copy suppressor of dom34Delta cold
    sensitivity, can restore some mRNA cleavage in a dom34Delta strain. These results
    identify important functional regions of Dom34 and suggest that the proposed endonuclease
    activity of Dom34 is not required for mRNA cleavage in NGD. We also provide evidence
    that the process of NGD is conserved in insect cells. On the basis of these results
    and the process of translation termination, we suggest a multistep model for the
    process of NGD.

  abstract: Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum is a complex process whose
    malfunction is implicated in disease and aging. By using the cell's endogenous
    sensor (the unfolded protein response), we identified several hundred yeast genes
    with roles in endoplasmic reticulum folding and systematically characterized their
    functional interdependencies by measuring unfolded protein response levels in
    double mutants. This strategy revealed multiple conserved factors critical for
    endoplasmic reticulum folding, including an intimate dependence on the later secretory
    pathway, a previously uncharacterized six-protein transmembrane complex, and a
    co-chaperone complex that delivers tail-anchored proteins to their membrane insertion
    machinery. The use of a quantitative reporter in a comprehensive screen followed
    by systematic analysis of genetic dependencies should be broadly applicable to
    functional dissection of complex cellular processes from yeast to human.

  abstract: 'Reversible protein phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism involved
    in all cellular processes. To create a systems view of the signaling apparatus
    in budding yeast, we generated an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) comprised
    of 100,000 pairwise, quantitative genetic interactions, including virtually all
    protein and small-molecule kinases and phosphatases as well as key cellular regulators.
    Quantitative genetic interaction mapping reveals factors working in compensatory
    pathways (negative genetic interactions) or those operating in linear pathways
    (positive genetic interactions). We found an enrichment of positive genetic interactions
    between kinases, phosphatases, and their substrates. In addition, we assembled
    a higher-order map from sets of three genes that display strong interactions with
    one another: triplets enriched for functional connectivity. The resulting network
    view provides insights into signaling pathway regulation and reveals a link between
    the cell-cycle kinase, Cak1, the Fus3 MAP kinase, and a pathway that regulates
    chromatin integrity during transcription by RNA polymerase II.'

  abstract: Techniques for systematically monitoring protein translation have lagged
    far behind methods for measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Here, we present
    a ribosome-profiling strategy that is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected
    mRNA fragments and enables genome-wide investigation of translation with subcodon
    resolution. We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under
    both rich and starvation conditions. These studies defined the protein sequences
    being translated and found extensive translational control in both determining
    absolute protein abundance and responding to environmental stress. We also observed
    distinct phases during translation that involve a large decrease in ribosome density
    going from early to late peptide elongation as well as widespread regulated initiation
    at non-adenine-uracil-guanine (AUG) codons. Ribosome profiling is readily adaptable
    to other organisms, making high-precision investigation of protein translation
    experimentally accessible.

  abstract: Large-scale genetic interaction studies provide the basis for defining
    gene function and pathway architecture. Recent advances in the ability to generate
    double mutants en masse in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have dramatically accelerated
    the acquisition of genetic interaction information and the biological inferences
    that follow. Here we describe a method based on F factor-driven conjugation, which
    allows for high-throughput generation of double mutants in Escherichia coli. This
    method, termed genetic interaction analysis technology for E. coli (GIANT-coli),
    permits us to systematically generate and array double-mutant cells on solid media
    in high-density arrays. We show that colony size provides a robust and quantitative
    output of cellular fitness and that GIANT-coli can recapitulate known synthetic
    interactions and identify previously unidentified negative (synthetic sickness
    or lethality) and positive (suppressive or epistatic) relationships. Finally,
    we describe a complementary strategy for genome-wide suppressor-mutant identification.
    Together, these methods permit rapid, large-scale genetic interaction studies
    in E. coli.

  abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) must target potentially toxic misfolded
    proteins for retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation while avoiding destruction
    of productive folding intermediates. For luminal proteins, this discrimination
    typically depends not only on the folding status of a polypeptide, but also on
    its glycosylation state. Two putative sugar binding proteins, Htm1p and Yos9p,
    are required for degradation of misfolded glycoproteins, but the nature of the
    glycan degradation signal and how such signals are generated and decoded remains
    unclear. Here we characterize Yos9p's oligosaccharide-binding specificity and
    find that it recognizes glycans containing terminal alpha1,6-linked mannose residues.
    We also provide evidence in vivo that a terminal alpha1,6-linked mannose-containing
    oligosaccharide is required for degradation and that Htm1p acts upstream of Yos9p
    to mediate the generation of such sugars. This strategy of marking potential substrates
    by Htm1p and decoding the signal by Yos9p is well suited to provide a proofreading
    mechanism that enhances substrate specificity.

  abstract: We used a quantitative, high-density genetic interaction map, or E-MAP
    (Epistatic MiniArray Profile), to interrogate the relationships within and between
    RNA-processing pathways. Due to their complexity and the essential roles of many
    of the components, these pathways have been difficult to functionally dissect.
    Here, we report the results for 107,155 individual interactions involving 552
    mutations, 166 of which are hypomorphic alleles of essential genes. Our data enabled
    the discovery of links between components of the mRNA export and splicing machineries
    and Sem1/Dss1, a component of the 19S proteasome. In particular, we demonstrate
    that Sem1 has a proteasome-independent role in mRNA export as a functional component
    of the Sac3-Thp1 complex. Sem1 also interacts with Csn12, a component of the COP9
    signalosome. Finally, we show that Csn12 plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing, which
    is independent of other signalosome components. Thus, Sem1 is involved in three
    separate and functionally distinct complexes.

  abstract: Prions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are inherited ordered aggregates reliant
    upon the disaggregase Hsp104 for stable maintenance. The function of other factors
    in the natural prion cycle is unclear. We constructed yeast-bacterial chimeric
    chaperones to resolve the roles of Hsp104 domains, and by extension chaperones
    that interact with these domains, in prion propagation. Our results show that,
    as with amorphous aggregate dissolution, the Hsp70/40 system recruits prion substrates
    to Hsp104 via its top ring. By adapting our chimera to couple to an inactive protease
    "trap," we monitored the reaction products of prion propagation in vivo. We find
    that prion maintenance is accompanied by translocation of prion proteins through
    Hsp104 hexamers and that both processes critically rely upon the Hsp40 Sis1. Our
    data suggest that yeast prion replication is a natural extension of chaperone
    activity in dissolving amorphous aggregates, distinguished from its ancestral
    reaction by the ordered, self-propagating structure of the substrate.

  abstract: 'Significant insight about biological networks arises from the study of
    network motifs--overly abundant network subgraphs--but such wiring patterns do
    not specify when and how potential routes within a cellular network are used.
    To address this limitation, we introduce activity motifs, which capture patterns
    in the dynamic use of a network. Using this framework to analyze transcription
    in Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, we find that cells use different timing
    activity motifs to optimize transcription timing in response to changing conditions:
    forward activation to produce metabolic compounds efficiently, backward shutoff
    to rapidly stop production of a detrimental product and synchronized activation
    for co-production of metabolites required for the same reaction. Measuring protein
    abundance over a time course reveals that mRNA timing motifs also occur at the
    protein level. Timing motifs significantly overlap with binding activity motifs,
    where genes in a linear chain have ordered binding affinity to a transcription
    factor, suggesting a mechanism for ordered transcription. Finely timed transcriptional
    regulation is therefore abundant in yeast metabolism, optimizing the organism''s
    adaptation to new environmental conditions.'

  abstract: An epistasis map (E-MAP) was constructed in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces
    pombe, by systematically measuring the phenotypes associated with pairs of mutations.
    This high-density, quantitative genetic interaction map focused on various aspects
    of chromosome function, including transcription regulation and DNA repair/replication.
    The E-MAP uncovered a previously unidentified component of the RNA interference
    (RNAi) machinery (rsh1) and linked the RNAi pathway to several other biological
    processes. Comparison of the S. pombe E-MAP to an analogous genetic map from the
    budding yeast revealed that, whereas negative interactions were conserved between
    genes involved in similar biological processes, positive interactions and overall
    genetic profiles between pairs of genes coding for physically associated proteins
    were even more conserved. Hence, conservation occurs at the level of the functional
    module (protein complex), but the genetic cross talk between modules can differ
    substantially.

  abstract: Tail-anchored (TA) proteins, defined by the presence of a single C-terminal
    transmembrane domain (TMD), play critical roles throughout the secretory pathway
    and in mitochondria, yet the machinery responsible for their proper membrane insertion
    remains poorly characterized. Here we show that Get3, the yeast homolog of the
    TA-interacting factor Asna1/Trc40, specifically recognizes TMDs of TA proteins
    destined for the secretory pathway. Get3 recognition represents a key decision
    step, whose loss can lead to misinsertion of TA proteins into mitochondria. Get3-TA
    protein complexes are recruited for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane insertion
    by the Get1/Get2 receptor. In vivo, the absence of Get1/Get2 leads to cytosolic
    aggregation of Get3-TA complexes and broad defects in TA protein biogenesis. In
    vitro reconstitution demonstrates that the Get proteins directly mediate insertion
    of newly synthesized TA proteins into ER membranes. Thus, the GET complex represents
    a critical mechanism for ensuring efficient and accurate targeting of TA proteins.

  abstract: A major challenge in the post-genomic era is the development of experimental
    approaches to monitor the properties of proteins on a proteome-wide level. It
    would be particularly useful to systematically assay protein subcellular localization,
    post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions, both at steady
    state and in response to environmental stimuli. Development of new reagents and
    methods will enhance our ability to do so efficiently and systematically. Here
    we describe the construction of two collections of budding yeast strains that
    facilitate proteome-wide measurements of protein properties. These collections
    consist of strains with an epitope tag integrated at the C-terminus of essentially
    every open reading frame (ORF), one with the tandem affinity purification (TAP)
    tag, and one with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag. We show that in both
    of these collections we have accurately tagged a high proportion of all ORFs (approximately
    75% of the proteome) by confirming expression of the fusion proteins. Furthermore,
    we demonstrate the use of the TAP collection in performing high-throughput immunoprecipitation
    experiments. Building on these collections and the methods described in this paper,
    we hope that the yeast community will expand both the quantity and type of proteome
    level data available.

  abstract: Functional genomic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have contributed
    enormously to our understanding of cellular processes. Their full potential, however,
    has been hampered by the limited availability of reagents to systematically study
    essential genes and the inability to quantify the small effects of most gene deletions
    on growth. Here we describe the construction of a library of hypomorphic alleles
    of essential genes and a high-throughput growth competition assay to measure fitness
    with unprecedented sensitivity. These tools dramatically increase the breadth
    and precision with which quantitative genetic analysis can be performed in yeast.
    We illustrate the value of these approaches by using genetic interactions to reveal
    new relationships between chromatin-modifying factors and to create a functional
    map of the proteasome. Finally, by measuring the fitness of strains in the yeast
    deletion library, we addressed an enigma regarding the apparent prevalence of
    gene dispensability and found that most genes do contribute to growth.

    amyloid formation of the yeast and mouse prion proteins Sup35 and recMoPrP in
    a manner characteristic of colloidal inhibition. Similarly, three known anti-amyloid
    molecules inhibited beta-lactamase in a detergent-dependent manner, which suggests
    that they too form colloidal aggregates. The colloids localized to preformed fibers
    and prevented new fiber formation in electron micrographs. They also blocked infection
    of yeast cells with Sup35 prions, which suggests that colloidal inhibition may
    be relevant in more biological milieus.

  abstract: Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels form gates in the cell membrane
    that regulate the flow of K(+) ions into and out of the cell, thereby influencing
    the membrane potential and electrical signaling of many cell types, including
    neurons and cardiomyocytes. Kir-channel function depends on other cellular proteins
    that aid in the folding of channel subunits, assembly into tetrameric complexes,
    trafficking of quality-controlled channels to the plasma membrane, and regulation
    of channel activity at the cell surface. We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
    as a model system to identify proteins necessary for the functional expression
    of a mammalian Kir channel at the cell surface. A screen of 376 yeast strains,
    each lacking one nonessential protein localized to the early secretory pathway,
    identified seven deletion strains in which functional expression of the Kir channel
    at the plasma membrane was impaired. Six deletions were of genes with known functions
    in trafficking and lipid biosynthesis (sur4Delta, csg2Delta, erv14Delta, emp24Delta,
    erv25Delta, and bst1Delta), and one deletion was of an uncharacterized gene (yil039wDelta).
    We provide genetic and functional evidence that Yil039wp, a conserved, phosphoesterase
    domain-containing protein, which we named "trafficking of Emp24p/Erv25p-dependent
    cargo disrupted 1" (Ted1p), acts together with Emp24p/Erv25p in cargo exit from
    the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The seven yeast proteins identified in our screen
    likely impact Kir-channel functional expression at the level of vesicle budding
    from the ER and/or the local lipid environment at the plasma membrane.

    strategies, PEM-1 and PEM-2, which allow for high-throughput double mutant generation
    in the fission yeast, S. pombe. These approaches take advantage of a previously
    undescribed, recessive, cycloheximide-resistance mutation. Both systems can be
    used for genome-wide screens or for the generation of high-density, quantitative
    epistatic miniarray profiles (E-MAPs). Since S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are evolutionary
    distant, this methodology will provide insight into conserved biological pathways
    that are present in S. pombe, but not S. cerevisiae, and will enable a comprehensive
    analysis of the conservation of genetic interaction networks.

  abstract: Among the many surprises to arise from studies of prion biology, perhaps
    the most unexpected is the strain phenomenon whereby a single protein can misfold
    into structurally distinct, infectious states that cause distinguishable phenotypes.
    Similarly, proteins can adopt a spectrum of conformations in non-infectious diseases
    of protein folding; some are toxic and others are well tolerated. However, our
    understanding of the structural differences underlying prion strains and how these
    differences alter their physiological impact remains limited. Here we use a combination
    of solution NMR, amide hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange and mutagenesis to study
    the structural differences between two strain conformations, termed Sc4 and Sc37
    (ref. 5), of the yeast Sup35 prion. We find that these two strains have an overlapping
    amyloid core spanning most of the Gln/Asn-rich first 40 amino acids that is highly
    protected from H/D exchange and very sensitive to mutation. These features indicate
    that the cores are composed of tightly packed beta-sheets possibly resembling
    'steric zipper' structures revealed by X-ray crystallography of Sup35-derived
    peptides. The stable structure is greatly expanded in the Sc37 conformation to
    encompass the first 70 amino acids, revealing why this strain shows increased
    fibre stability and decreased ability to undergo chaperone-mediated replication.
    Our findings establish that prion strains involve large-scale conformational differences
    and provide a structural basis for understanding a broad range of functional studies,
    including how conformational changes alter the physiological impact of prion strains.

  abstract: Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are essential lipids whose functional
    diversity is enabled by variation in their chain length. The full VLCFA biosynthetic
    machinery and how this machinery generates structural diversity remain elusive.
    Proteoliposomes reconstituted here from purified membrane components-an elongase
    protein (Elop), a novel dehydratase, and two reductases-catalyzed repeated rounds
    of two-carbon addition that elongated shorter FAs into VLCFAs whose length was
    dictated by the specific Elop homolog present. Mutational analysis revealed that
    the Elop active site faces the cytosol, whereas VLCFA length is determined by
    a lysine near the luminal end of an Elop transmembrane helix. By stepping the
    lysine residue along one face of the helix toward the cytosol, we engineered novel
    synthases with correspondingly shorter VLCFA outputs. Thus the distance between
    the active site and the lysine residue determines chain length. Our results uncover
    a mutationally adjustable, caliper-like mechanism that generates the repertoire
    of cellular VLCFAs.

  abstract: The yeast Mec1/Tel1 kinases, ATM/ATR in mammals, coordinate the DNA damage
    response by phosphorylating proteins involved in DNA repair and checkpoint pathways.
    Recently, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the INO80 complex,
    have also been implicated in DNA damage responses, although regulatory mechanisms
    that direct their function remain unknown. Here, we show that the Ies4 subunit
    of the INO80 complex is phosphorylated by the Mec1/Tel1 kinases during exposure
    to DNA-damaging agents. Mutation of Ies4's phosphorylation sites does not significantly
    affect DNA repair processes, but does influence DNA damage checkpoint responses.
    Additionally, ies4 phosphorylation mutants are linked to the function of checkpoint
    regulators, such as the replication checkpoint factors Tof1 and Rad53. These findings
    establish a chromatin remodeling complex as a functional component in the Mec1/Tel1
    DNA damage signaling pathway that modulates checkpoint responses and suggest that
    posttranslational modification of chromatin remodeling complexes regulates their
    involvement in distinct processes.

  abstract: Many genes can be deleted with little phenotypic consequences. By what
    mechanism and to what extent the presence of duplicate genes in the genome contributes
    to this robustness against deletions has been the subject of considerable interest.
    Here, we exploit the availability of high-density genetic interaction maps to
    provide direct support for the role of backup compensation, where functionally
    overlapping duplicates cover for the loss of their paralog. However, we find that
    the overall contribution of duplicates to robustness against null mutations is
    low ( approximately 25%). The ability to directly identify buffering paralogs
    allowed us to further study their properties, and how they differ from non-buffering
    duplicates. Using environmental sensitivity profiles as well as quantitative genetic
    interaction spectra as high-resolution phenotypes, we establish that even duplicate
    pairs with compensation capacity exhibit rich and typically non-overlapping deletion
    phenotypes, and are thus unable to comprehensively cover against loss of their
    paralog. Our findings reconcile the fact that duplicates can compensate for each
    other's loss under a limited number of conditions with the evolutionary instability
    of genes whose loss is not associated with a phenotypic penalty.

  abstract: The proteasome regulates histone lysine methylation and gene transcription,
    but how it does so is poorly understood. To better understand this process, we
    used the epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) approach to identify factors that
    genetically interact with proteasomal subunits. In addition to members of the
    Set1 complex that mediate histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me), we found that
    deleting members of the CCR4/NOT mRNA processing complex exhibit synthetic phenotypes
    when combined with proteasome mutants. Further biochemical analyses revealed physical
    associations between CCR4/NOT and the proteasome in vivo. Consistent with the
    genetic and biochemical interactions linking CCR4/NOT with proteasome and Set1-mediated
    methylation, we find that loss of Not4 decreases global and gene-specific H3K4
    trimethylation (H3K4me3) and decreases 19S proteasome recruitment to the PMA1
    gene. Similar to proteasome regulation of histone methylation, loss of CCR4/NOT
    members does not affect ubiquitinated H2B. Mapping of Not4 identified the RING
    finger domain as essential for H3K4me3, suggesting a role for ubiquitin in this
    process. Consistent with this idea, loss of the Not4-interacting protein Ubc4,
    a known ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, decreases H3K4me3. These studies implicate
    CCR4/NOT in the regulation of H3K4me3 through a ubiquitin-dependent pathway that
    likely involves the proteasome.

  abstract: Defining the functional relationships between proteins is critical for
    understanding virtually all aspects of cell biology. Large-scale identification
    of protein complexes has provided one important step towards this goal; however,
    even knowledge of the stoichiometry, affinity and lifetime of every protein-protein
    interaction would not reveal the functional relationships between and within such
    complexes. Genetic interactions can provide functional information that is largely
    invisible to protein-protein interaction data sets. Here we present an epistatic
    miniarray profile (E-MAP) consisting of quantitative pairwise measurements of
    the genetic interactions between 743 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in
    various aspects of chromosome biology (including DNA replication/repair, chromatid
    segregation and transcriptional regulation). This E-MAP reveals that physical
    interactions fall into two well-represented classes distinguished by whether or
    not the individual proteins act coherently to carry out a common function. Thus,
    genetic interaction data make it possible to dissect functionally multi-protein
    complexes, including Mediator, and to organize distinct protein complexes into
    pathways. In one pathway defined here, we show that Rtt109 is the founding member
    of a novel class of histone acetyltransferases responsible for Asf1-dependent
    acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56. This modification, in turn, enables a
    ubiquitin ligase complex containing the cullin Rtt101 to ensure genomic integrity
    during DNA replication.

  abstract: Defining protein complexes is critical to virtually all aspects of cell
    biology. Two recent affinity purification/mass spectrometry studies in Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae have vastly increased the available protein interaction data. The practical
    utility of such high throughput interaction sets, however, is substantially decreased
    by the presence of false positives. Here we created a novel probabilistic metric
    that takes advantage of the high density of these data, including both the presence
    and absence of individual associations, to provide a measure of the relative confidence
    of each potential protein-protein interaction. This analysis largely overcomes
    the noise inherent in high throughput immunoprecipitation experiments. For example,
    of the 12,122 binary interactions in the general repository of interaction data
    (BioGRID) derived from these two studies, we marked 7504 as being of substantially
    lower confidence. Additionally, applying our metric and a stringent cutoff we
    identified a set of 9074 interactions (including 4456 that were not among the
    12,122 interactions) with accuracy comparable to that of conventional small scale
    methodologies. Finally we organized proteins into coherent multisubunit complexes
    using hierarchical clustering. This work thus provides a highly accurate physical
    interaction map of yeast in a format that is readily accessible to the biological
    community.

  abstract: Although a range of robust techniques exists for transforming organisms
    with nucleic acids, approaches for introducing proteins into cells are far less
    developed. Here we describe a facile and highly efficient protein transformation
    protocol suitable for introducing prion particles, produced in vitro from pure
    protein or purified from an in vivo source, into yeast. Prion particles composed
    of amyloid forms of fragments of Sup35p, the protein determinant of the yeast
    prion state [PSI(+)], lead to dose-dependent de novo induction of [PSI(+)] with
    efficiencies approaching 100% at high protein concentrations. We also describe
    a procedure for generating distinct, self-propagating amyloid conformations of
    a prionogenic Sup35p fragment termed Sup-NM. Remarkably, infection of yeast with
    different Sup-NM amyloid conformations leads to distinct [PSI(+)] prion strains,
    establishing that the heritable differences in prion strain differences result
    directly from self-propagating differences in the conformations of the infectious
    protein. This protein transformation protocol can be readily adapted to the analysis
    of other yeast prion states, as well as to test the infectious (prion) nature
    of protein extracts from less well-characterized epigenetic traits. More generally,
    the protein transformation procedure makes it possible to bridge in vitro and
    in vivo studies, thus greatly facilitating efforts to explain the structural and
    mechanistic basis of prion inheritance.

  abstract: How the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery accurately identifies
    terminally misfolded proteins is poorly understood. For luminal ERAD substrates,
    this recognition depends on their folding and glycosylation status as well as
    on the conserved ER lectin Yos9p. Here we show that Yos9p is part of a stable
    complex that organizes key components of ERAD machinery on both sides of the ER
    membrane, including the transmembrane ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p. We further demonstrate
    that Yos9p, together with Kar2p and Hrd3p, forms a luminal surveillance complex
    that both recruits nonnative proteins to the core ERAD machinery and assists a
    distinct sugar-dependent step necessary to commit substrates for degradation.
    When Hrd1p is uncoupled from the Yos9p surveillance complex, degradation can occur
    independently of the requirement for glycosylation. Thus, Yos9p/Kar2p/Hrd3p acts
    as a gatekeeper, ensuring correct identification of terminally misfolded proteins
    by recruiting misfolded forms to the ERAD machinery, contributing to the interrogation
    of substrate sugar status, and preventing glycosylation-independent degradation.

  abstract: The unfolded protein response (UPR) allows the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
    to recover from the accumulation of misfolded proteins, in part by increasing
    its folding capacity. Inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) promotes this remodeling
    by detecting misfolded ER proteins and activating a transcription factor, X-box-binding
    protein 1, through endonucleolytic cleavage of its messenger RNA (mRNA). Here,
    we report that IRE1 independently mediates the rapid degradation of a specific
    subset of mRNAs, based both on their localization to the ER membrane and on the
    amino acid sequence they encode. This response is well suited to complement other
    UPR mechanisms because it could selectively halt production of proteins that challenge
    the ER and clear the translocation and folding machinery for the subsequent remodeling
    process.

  abstract: A principle that has emerged from studies of protein aggregation is that
    proteins typically can misfold into a range of different aggregated forms. Moreover,
    the phenotypic and pathological consequences of protein aggregation depend critically
    on the specific misfolded form. A striking example of this is the prion strain
    phenomenon, in which prion particles composed of the same protein cause distinct
    heritable states. Accumulating evidence from yeast prions such as [PSI+] and mammalian
    prions argues that differences in the prion conformation underlie prion strain
    variants. Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood why changes in the conformation
    of misfolded proteins alter their physiological effects. Here we present and experimentally
    validate an analytical model describing how [PSI+] strain phenotypes arise from
    the dynamic interaction among the effects of prion dilution, competition for a
    limited pool of soluble protein, and conformation-dependent differences in prion
    growth and division rates. Analysis of three distinct prion conformations of yeast
    Sup35 (the [PSI+] protein determinant) and their in vivo phenotypes reveals that
    the Sup35 amyloid causing the strongest phenotype surprisingly shows the slowest
    growth. This slow growth, however, is more than compensated for by an increased
    brittleness that promotes prion division. The propensity of aggregates to undergo
    breakage, thereby generating new seeds, probably represents a key determinant
    of their physiological impact for both infectious (prion) and non-infectious amyloids.

  abstract: A major goal of biology is to provide a quantitative description of cellular
    behaviour. This task, however, has been hampered by the difficulty in measuring
    protein abundances and their variation. Here we present a strategy that pairs
    high-throughput flow cytometry and a library of GFP-tagged yeast strains to monitor
    rapidly and precisely protein levels at single-cell resolution. Bulk protein abundance
    measurements of >2,500 proteins in rich and minimal media provide a detailed view
    of the cellular response to these conditions, and capture many changes not observed
    by DNA microarray analyses. Our single-cell data argue that noise in protein expression
    is dominated by the stochastic production/destruction of messenger RNAs. Beyond
    this global trend, there are dramatic protein-specific differences in noise that
    are strongly correlated with a protein's mode of transcription and its function.
    For example, proteins that respond to environmental changes are noisy whereas
    those involved in protein synthesis are quiet. Thus, these studies reveal a remarkable
    structure to biological noise and suggest that protein noise levels have been
    selected to reflect the costs and potential benefits of this variation.

  abstract: Identification of protein-protein interactions often provides insight

    proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each preparation was analysed
    by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
    and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to increase coverage and accuracy.
    Machine learning was used to integrate the mass spectrometry scores and assign
    probabilities to the protein-protein interactions. Among 4,087 different proteins
    identified with high confidence by mass spectrometry from 2,357 successful purifications,
    our core data set (median precision of 0.69) comprises 7,123 protein-protein interactions
    involving 2,708 proteins. A Markov clustering algorithm organized these interactions
    into 547 protein complexes averaging 4.9 subunits per complex, about half of them
    absent from the MIPS database, as well as 429 additional interactions between
    pairs of complexes. The data (all of which are available online) will help future
    studies on individual proteins as well as functional genomics and systems biology.

  abstract: 'Native disulfide bond formation in eukaryotes is dependent on protein-disulfide
    isomerase (PDI) and its homologs, which contain varying combinations of catalytically
    active and inactive thioredoxin domains. However, the specific contribution of
    PDI to the formation of new disulfides versus reduction/rearrangement of non-native
    disulfides is poorly understood. We analyzed the role of individual PDI domains
    in disulfide bond formation in a reaction driven by their natural oxidant, Ero1p.
    We found that Ero1p oxidizes the isolated PDI catalytic thioredoxin domains, A
    and A'' at the same rate. In contrast, we found that in the context of full-length
    PDI, there is an asymmetry in the rate of oxidation of the two active sites. This
    asymmetry is the result of a dual effect: an enhanced rate of oxidation of the
    second catalytic (A'') domain and the substrate-mediated inhibition of oxidation
    of the first catalytic (A) domain. The specific order of thioredoxin domains in
    PDI is important in establishing the asymmetry in the rate of oxidation of the
    two active sites thus allowing A and A'', two thioredoxin domains that are similar
    in sequence and structure, to serve opposing functional roles as a disulfide isomerase
    and disulfide oxidase, respectively. These findings reveal how native disulfide
    folding is accomplished in the endoplasmic reticulum and provide a context for
    understanding the proliferation of PDI homologs with combinatorial arrangements
    of thioredoxin domains.'

  abstract: The yeast histone deacetylase Rpd3 can be recruited to promoters to repress
    transcription initiation. Biochemical, genetic, and gene-expression analyses show
    that Rpd3 exists in two distinct complexes. The smaller complex, Rpd3C(S), shares
    Sin3 and Ume1 with Rpd3C(L) but contains the unique subunits Rco1 and Eaf3. Rpd3C(S)
    mutants exhibit phenotypes remarkably similar to those of Set2, a histone methyltransferase
    associated with elongating RNA polymerase II. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and
    biochemical experiments indicate that the chromodomain of Eaf3 recruits Rpd3C(S)
    to nucleosomes methylated by Set2 on histone H3 lysine 36, leading to deacetylation
    of transcribed regions. This pathway apparently acts to negatively regulate transcription
    because deleting the genes for Set2 or Rpd3C(S) bypasses the requirement for the
    positive elongation factor Bur1/Bur2.

  abstract: We present a strategy for generating and analyzing comprehensive genetic-interaction
    maps, termed E-MAPs (epistatic miniarray profiles), comprising quantitative measures
    of aggravating or alleviating interactions between gene pairs. Crucial to the
    interpretation of E-MAPs is their high-density nature made possible by focusing
    on logically connected gene subsets and including essential genes. Described here
    is the analysis of an E-MAP of genes acting in the yeast early secretory pathway.
    Hierarchical clustering, together with novel analytical strategies and experimental
    verification, revealed or clarified the role of many proteins involved in extensively
    studied processes such as sphingolipid metabolism and retention of HDEL proteins.
    At a broader level, analysis of the E-MAP delineated pathway organization and
    components of physical complexes and illustrated the interconnection between the
    various secretory processes. Extension of this strategy to other logically connected
    gene subsets in yeast and higher eukaryotes should provide critical insights into
    the functional/organizational principles of biological systems.

  abstract: ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of glycoproteins depends on dual recognition
    of protein misfolding and remodeling of the substrate's N-linked glycans. After
    recognition, substrates are retrotranslocated to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation.
    To explore the directionality of this process, we fused a highly stable protein,
    DHFR, to the N or C terminus of the soluble ERAD substrate CPY* in yeast. Degradation
    of the C-terminal CPY*-DHFR fusion is markedly slowed and is accompanied by DHFR
    release in the ER lumen. Thus, folded lumenal domains can impede protein retrotranslocation.
    The ER lumenal protein Yos9p is required for both release of DHFR and degradation
    of multiple ERAD substrates. Yos9p forms a complex with substrates and has a sugar
    binding pocket that is essential for its ERAD function. Nonetheless, substrate
    recognition persists even when the sugar binding site is mutated or CPY* is unglycosylated.
    These and other considerations suggest that Yos9p plays a critical role in the
    bipartite recognition of terminally misfolded glycoproteins.

  abstract: Efficiency of interspecies prion transmission decreases as the primary
    structures of the infectious proteins diverge. Yet, a single prion protein can
    misfold into multiple infectious conformations, and such differences in "strain
    conformation" also alter infection specificity. Here, we explored the relationship
    between prion strains and species barriers by creating distinct synthetic prion
    forms of the yeast prion protein Sup35. We identified a strain conformation of
    Sup35 that allows transmission from the S. cerevisiae (Sc) Sup35 to the highly
    divergent C. albicans (Ca) Sup35 both in vivo and in vitro. Remarkably, cross-species
    transmission leads to a novel Ca strain that in turn can infect the Sc protein.
    Structural studies reveal strain-specific conformational differences in regions
    of the prion domain that are involved in intermolecular contacts. Our findings
    support a model whereby strain conformation is the critical determinant of cross-species
    prion transmission while primary structure affects transmission specificity by
    altering the spectrum of preferred amyloid conformations.

  abstract: Abundant nonfibrillar oligomeric intermediates are a common feature of
    amyloid formation, and these oligomers, rather than the final fibers, have been
    suggested to be the toxic species in some amyloid diseases. Whether such oligomers
    are critical intermediates for fiber assembly or form in an alternate, potentially
    separable pathway, however, remains unclear. Here we study the polymerization
    of the amyloidogenic yeast prion protein Sup35. Rapid polymerization occurs in
    the absence of observable intermediates, and both targeted kinetic and direct
    single-molecule fluorescence measurements indicate that fibers grow by monomer
    addition. A three-step model (nucleation, monomer addition, and fiber fragmentation)
    accurately accounts for the distinctive kinetic features of amyloid formation,
    including weak concentration dependence, acceleration by agitation, and sigmoidal
    shape of the polymerization time course. Thus, amyloid growth can occur by monomer
    addition in a reaction distinct from and competitive with formation of potentially
    toxic oligomeric intermediates.

  abstract: 'The prion hypothesis proposes that proteins can act as infectious agents.
    Originally formulated to explain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs),
    the prion hypothesis has been extended with the finding that several non-Mendelian
    traits in fungi are due to heritable changes in protein conformation, which may
    in some cases be beneficial. Although much remains to be learned about the specific
    role of cellular cofactors, mechanistic parallels between the mammalian and yeast
    prion phenomena point to universal features of conformation-based infection and
    inheritance involving propagation of ordered beta-sheet-rich protein aggregates
    commonly referred to as amyloid. Here we focus on two such features and discuss
    recent efforts to explain them in terms of the physical properties of amyloid-like
    aggregates. The first is prion strains, wherein chemically identical infectious
    particles cause distinct phenotypes. The second is barriers that often prohibit
    prion transmission between different species. There is increasing evidence suggesting
    that both of these can be manifestations of the same phenomenon: the ability of
    a protein to misfold into multiple self-propagating conformations. Even single
    mutations can change the spectrum of favored misfolded conformations. In turn,
    changes in amyloid conformation can shift the specificity of propagation and alter
    strain phenotypes. This model helps explain many common and otherwise puzzling
    features of prion inheritance as well as aspects of noninfectious diseases involving
    toxic misfolded proteins.'

  abstract: 'Many proteins can misfold into beta-sheet-rich, self-seeding polymers
    (amyloids). Prions are exceptional among such aggregates in that they are also
    infectious. In fungi, prions are not pathogenic but rather act as epigenetic regulators
    of cell physiology, providing a powerful model for studying the mechanism of prion
    replication. We used prion-forming domains from two budding yeast proteins (Sup35p
    and New1p) to examine the requirements for prion formation and inheritance. In
    both proteins, a glutamine/asparagine-rich (Q/N-rich) tract mediates sequence-specific
    aggregation, while an adjacent motif, the oligopeptide repeat, is required for
    the replication and stable inheritance of these aggregates. Our findings help
    to explain why although Q/N-rich proteins are relatively common, few form heritable
    aggregates: prion inheritance requires both an aggregation sequence responsible
    for self-seeded growth and an element that permits chaperone-dependent replication
    of the aggregate. Using this knowledge, we have designed novel artificial prions
    by fusing the replication element of Sup35p to aggregation-prone sequences from
    other proteins, including pathogenically expanded polyglutamine.'

  abstract: A remarkable feature of prion biology is the strain phenomenon wherein
    prion particles apparently composed of the same protein lead to phenotypically
    distinct transmissible states. To reconcile the existence of strains with the
    'protein-only' hypothesis of prion transmission, it has been proposed that a single
    protein can misfold into multiple distinct infectious forms, one for each different
    strain. Several studies have found correlations between strain phenotypes and
    conformations of prion particles; however, whether such differences cause or are
    simply a secondary manifestation of prion strains remains unclear, largely due
    to the difficulty of creating infectious material from pure protein. Here we report
    a high-efficiency protocol for infecting yeast with the [PSI+] prion using amyloids
    composed of a recombinant Sup35 fragment (Sup-NM). Using thermal stability and
    electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that Sup-NM amyloids
    formed at different temperatures adopt distinct, stably propagating conformations.
    Infection of yeast with these different amyloid conformations leads to different
    [PSI+] strains. These results establish that Sup-NM adopts an infectious conformation
    before entering the cell--fulfilling a key prediction of the prion hypothesis--and
    directly demonstrate that differences in the conformation of the infectious protein
    determine prion strain variation.

  abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides an environment that is highly
    optimized for oxidative protein folding. Rather than relying on small molecule
    oxidants like glutathione, it is now clear that disulfide formation is driven
    by a protein relay involving Ero1, a novel conserved FAD-dependent enzyme, and
    protein disulfide isomerase (PDI); Ero1 is oxidized by molecular oxygen and in
    turn acts as a specific oxidant of PDI, which then directly oxidizes disulfide
    bonds in folding proteins. While providing a robust driving force for disulfide
    formation, the use of molecular oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor can lead
    to oxidative stress through the production of reactive oxygen species and oxidized
    glutathione. How Ero1p distinguishes between the many different PDI-related proteins
    and how the cell minimizes the effects of oxidative damage from Ero1 remain important
    open questions.

  abstract: The availability of complete genomic sequences and technologies that allow
    comprehensive analysis of global expression profiles of messenger RNA have greatly
    expanded our ability to monitor the internal state of a cell. Yet biological systems
    ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification
    of proteins--and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation
    makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein
    analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each
    open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its
    natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain
    a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their
    absolute levels. We find that about 80% of the proteome is expressed during normal
    growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically
    identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than
    50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential
    proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily
    detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon
    bias measurements.

    in the context of compartments that organize them in the cellular environment.
    Here we describe the construction and analysis of a collection of yeast strains
    expressing full-length, chromosomally tagged green fluorescent protein fusion
    proteins. We classify these proteins, representing 75% of the yeast proteome,
    into 22 distinct subcellular localization categories, and provide localization
    information for 70% of previously unlocalized proteins. Analysis of this high-resolution,
    high-coverage localization data set in the context of transcriptional, genetic,
    and protein-protein interaction data helps reveal the logic of transcriptional
    co-regulation, and provides a comprehensive view of interactions within and between
    organelles in eukaryotic cells.

  abstract: 'Self-propagating beta-sheet-rich protein aggregates are implicated in
    a wide range of protein-misfolding phenomena, including amyloid diseases and prion-based
    inheritance. Two properties have emerged as common features of amyloids. Amyloid
    formation is ubiquitous: many unrelated proteins form such aggregates and even
    a single polypeptide can misfold into multiple forms--a process that is thought
    to underlie prion strain variation. Despite this promiscuity, amyloid propagation
    can be highly sequence specific: amyloid fibres often fail to catalyse the aggregation
    of other amyloidogenic proteins. In prions, this specificity leads to barriers
    that limit transmission between species. Using the yeast prion [PSI+], we show
    in vitro that point mutations in Sup35p, the protein determinant of [PSI+], alter
    the range of ''infectious'' conformations, which in turn changes amyloid seeding
    specificity. We generate a new transmission barrier in vivo by using these mutations
    to specifically disfavour subsets of prion strains. The ability of mutations to
    alter the conformations of amyloid states without preventing amyloid formation
    altogether provides a general mechanism for the generation of prion transmission
    barriers and may help to explain how mutations alter toxicity in conformational
    diseases.'

  abstract: GroEL/S chaperonin ring complexes fold many unrelated proteins. To understand
    the basis and extent of the chaperonin substrate spectrum, we used rounds of selection
    and DNA shuffling to obtain GroEL/S variants that dramatically enhanced folding
    of a single substrate-green fluorescent protein (GFP). Changes in the substrate-optimized
    chaperonins increase the polarity of the folding cavity and alter the ATPase cycle.
    These findings reveal a surprising plasticity of GroEL/S, which can be exploited
    to aid folding of recombinant proteins. Our studies also reveal a conflict between
    specialization and generalization of chaperonins as increased GFP folding comes
    at the expense of the ability of GroEL/S to fold its natural substrates. This
    conflict and the nature of the ring structure may help explain the evolution of
    cellular chaperone systems.

  abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports disulfide formation through an
    essential protein relay involving Ero1p and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI).
    We find that in addition to having a tightly associated flavin adenine dinucleotide
    (FAD) moiety, yeast Ero1p is highly responsive to small changes in physiological
    levels of free FAD. This sensitivity underlies the dependence of oxidative protein
    folding on cellular FAD levels. FAD is synthesized in the cytosol but can readily
    enter the ER lumen and promote Ero1p-catalyzed oxidation. Ero1p then uses molecular
    oxygen as its preferred terminal electron acceptor. Thus Ero1p directly couples
    disulfide formation to the consumption of molecular oxygen, but its activity is
    modulated by free lumenal FAD levels, potentially linking disulfide formation
    to a cell's nutritional or metabolic status.

    Here we use a novel single fiber growth assay to examine the heterogeneity of

    multiple, distinct and faithfully propagating fiber types, which differ dramatically
    both in their degrees of polarity and overall growth rates. Both in terms of the
    number of distinct self-propagating fiber types, as well as the ability of these

    to account for the range of prion strain phenotypes observed in vivo.

  abstract: Infectious, self-propagating protein aggregates (prions) as well as structurally
    related amyloid fibrils have traditionally been associated with neurodegenerative
    diseases in mammals. However, recent work in fungi indicates that prions are not
    simply aberrations of protein folding, but are in fact widespread, conserved,
    and in certain cases, apparently beneficial. Analysis of prion behavior in yeast
    has led to insights into the mechanisms of prion appearance and propagation as
    well as the effect of prions on cellular physiology and perhaps evolution. The
    prion-forming proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are members of a larger class
    of Gln/Asn-rich proteins that is abundantly represented in the genomes of higher
    eukaryotes, raising the prospect of genetically programmed prion-like behavior
    in other organisms.
